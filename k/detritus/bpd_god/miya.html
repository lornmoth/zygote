<h2>On Automation</h2>


<div class="border">
	<h4>Cars</h4>
	<p>
Thinking about automated cars, about traffic. This what's solved: unoptimized driving -- forget pedantic trolley problem games (always solved: program for self-preservation). Humanity loses right to drive bc they dont deserve it: lrn2 respec fast lane, zipper merge, tailgate always.
</p><hr>
<p>Realistically, you're not going to get a grand dystopia. Your 'privacy' will be sold to advertisers, but that never mattered, and affects nothing. You already know that. The real crime is already here, the digital car - in all its plastic, electronic, automatic immodifiability.</p><hr>
<p>Radio signals will be used to tie cruise control to the automated cars in front of you. Highways will act like train stations, which you slot into. The local roads will still be free to fuck around in. You don't need public transport, fleets of articulated buses. This is better.</p><hr>
<p>You can still have your buses though, and they're better than metros. They'll just be a never ending chain, a dedicated lane on the highway, bumper to bumper, only giving space for entry and exit. Replace bike lanes with them. Bikes do not and have never belonged on the road.
</p><hr>
<p>We could easily already have "automated" w/o AI. Achieve self-correcting steering in lanes, and use radio to tie cruise control to shipping trucks or specific speeds set by transmitters on the highway. All cars form a line. Hands off. US could never do this, but China can today.</p><hr>
<p>Automated hands-free driving isn't what's interesting. What is interesting is optimization, which will inevitably lead to, if allowed to develop to its fullest, every aspect of the road monetized and through it capitalistically self-organized for total efficiency.</p><hr>
<p>The real payload carried by artificial intelligence is universal digital capitalism. AI is an optimization algorithm, and we will always see the best solution being capitalistic self-organization. Or: Capitalism is the optimization algorithm, and AI its self-assemblage.</p><hr>

	<h4>Vaporwave</h4>
<p>
	Aesthetically vaporwave is just a distributed imitation of James Ferraro's brand. Its mindnumbing arbitrariness could be easily be mass produced in the near future by ML - they're more unironically muzak than they realize.
</p><figure>https://youtu.be/cC6oY-tXEbY</figure><hr>
<p>It's relevance is in being a prominent early example of accelerated subcultural subsumption, as a microgenre centered around packaged neutering of just a single artist's brand & under a distributed, organic process that's only indirectly commercialized (via attention economy).
</p><hr><p>
Very soon, we won't need to rely on seeding a distributed complex of AI cargo cultists, aka content creators, with an aesthetic model for mass, arbitrarily varieted production as Ferraro did (DJ Screw might've done the same too if he lived in this era). We'll just use algos.</p><hr>
<p>Future artistry will be in algorithm design, as the variation demanded by consumption becomes increasingly arbitrarily produced. Artists can each generate their own fully serviced genre without resorting to a lifetime commitment to excessive production.</p><hr>

	<h2>On Tradition</h2>

<div class="border">
<p>
	Tradition is accumulated knowledge as a product of cultural evolution. It’s far more practically robust and reliable than scientific knowledge, but much less responsive, requiring multiple generations to discover reproductive solutions. It’s always deadly to end a tradition.
</p><hr>
<p>Modernity’s piecemeal decoupling of Tradition has broken us out of long-term cyclical survival into an irreversible stage of runaway capitalistic development (the singularity began millennia ago). It’s too late to return to Tradition except as reactionary, luddite’s last stand.</p><hr>
<p>The environment produced by modernity is irreducibly alien to traditions by rejecting its most fundamental axioms. They can only be studied and reintroduced wherever possible in a neo-traditionalism to limit the ill effects wrecked by short-sighted scientific knowledge.</p><hr>
<p>One possible solution to modernizing tradition is employing computer technology to simulate time-accelerated models, generating knowledge at a rate fast enough to keep up with modernity. Deep learning AI's trial & error accumulation of heuristics is essentially traditional.
</p><hr>
<p>Or rather than velocity, we could employ scale. By networking the collective human consciousness, unmitigated, properly analyzed, we can allow the Delphi effect (aggregate consensus more accurate than individual expert) to guide us on all matters.</p><p>At every level of human organization, to follow tradition is healthy, to replace it with science destructive. We're too far gone to return to non-modernity, but intuitive, evolved heuristics can still guide us wherever they're grown - if only to lessen the sting of annihilation.</p><hr>
