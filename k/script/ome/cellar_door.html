<h1 id="twenty-one">Twenty-one</h1>

<p class="no-indent">A mere fourteen days it took them to gaslipulate the boys down at <code>cmd</code> into opening cellar door. <em>cd? What cd? My seedbox is ruined!</em> Yeah yeah, hilarious story grandpa, go relive your SSH Neo Hague holofiche fantasies at the next 2K25 meetup. Wish I had more time to joke around like this. Hopped up on Xyraprex and Bithulane<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> these days so severely, I often wonder how I’m able to live a greater existence than simply enduring the interval between uplinks. <code>‘Hyoujou.’</code> Tastes like a net girlfriend. How insipid.</p>

<h2 id="the-brooding-sequence">The brooding sequence</h2>

<p class="no-indent"><em>“Hey handsome, looking for somebody?”</em> Sure I was, I always am.</p>

<p><em>“Yeah honey, how about you inform me of Charles Dinka’s current dwellings? If not, you could always let me pop one or two inside your mouth –and know I have both a functioning cock <strong>and</strong> this here little extendo snapcaster inside my trousers. I’ve got enough cash, don’t you worry about that.”</em> That’d scared the bitch into submission. Pointed me in the direction of an abandoned apartment building two blocks ahead. Cryptobrutalism, heh. Charles Dinka is a wary man nevertheless, as should be expected of the presupposed ringleader behind the crooks who evoked an <code>id</code><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> on <code>cellar door</code>. I say presupposed, because it’s entirely uncertain and unverified whether Charles Dinka has any sway over such an eminent transgression. I couldn’t care less, it’s fully outside of my concern as an iterative agent. Charles Dinka is a lacunar event pertaining to the very mechanistic nature of netspace<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and therefore bears the burden of an inner necessity from all of us. Of course a common alley whore would know of him when he’s near, anyone would. We are all one race when facing Charles ‘Demon God’ Dinka. How diverse is something devoid of colour?</p>

<p class="no-indent">Woke up inside a pool of disgusting remains of the Iambic Society<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. ‘Forsaken’ is the word that dared not slip away from my cybernetic tongue<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>. What was I doing again –oh right. Six cerebral dives in before I got disturbed. I brush off the duodenums from the lens, and commence yet another dive.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><code>“That’s not really going to cut it for you, am I not mistaken?”</code></p>
<p>A distorted voice permeates through my circuits. A melancholic tone which one would only recognise on a rainy evening walk through a dark alleyway, the shiny cobblestones lit up by purple and red hues from neon signs scattered around the narrow landscape above. Grow up, you fucking infantile piece of shit. Your only redeeming quality is that you’re a honest farce, at least. I leave you alone for a year and where do I find you? Languishing in the very same spot you decided to come into existence in. I hate you, you’re too noisy. Shut up. Shut up. SHUT UP. <strong>SHUTUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP—</strong></p>
<p>…</p>
<p><em>“[…] to the terminals over there. The sand […] and take care of it.”</em></p>
<p>After being roused by incessant thrumming from what I perceive as heavy machinery, I notice I’m laying on a field stretcher. I try to move my legs and sit upri–</p>
<p><em>“WHAT are you doing? Get back on that stretcher right now, you shouldn’t move in your current state whatsoever.”</em> What the hell? Why is Corvox here?</p>
<p><em>“And would you mind telling me where I am, and why of all people you’re here with me, Corvox?”</em></p>
<p><em>“You achieved synaptic overflow during your ‘cerebral dive’, as you itts<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> call it, and took down the entire Bedouin lifeline with you. Do you have any idea how much of a disturbance you caused within <code>cmd</code>?</em></p>
<p><em>“Bedouin?! Is that what this is, you’re working for those sacrosanct reprobates now? I’d rather log on to a legacy sim and get ontogenetically parsed rather than to be saved by the likes of them.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Listen up kid, you’re in no position to complain right now. They rototraced<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> a link on Dinka. All indices are valued at nil. You seem to have erased his virtusoma.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Karada-igai. . .”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yeah, I suppose it wasn’t as we thought. However, that doesn’t exempt you from liability. You’re going nowhere, kid.”</em></p>

<h2 id="the-sardonic-sequence">The sardonic sequence</h2>
<p class="no-indent">How many years has it been since? What a stupid question. What’s the matter, needed a prompt to subvocalise on? How badly you’d wanted to be a product of the intellect, and nothing more? To see yourself as an organism, will exerted through the organic nature of your body, with the mind being a slave to its needs and desires. How could you witness someone through written text in netspace and still believe such a thing? Communicative language with both its symbols and the meaning applied to those symbols through words into sentences as a fundamentally abstract way of thinking. Something inherently mechanistic that could yet only flow forth from the deepest reaches of the soul. Are you alone? Scrolling past messages from various people, those you might know in the flesh and those you might not know at all, doesn’t that feel more alone than being by yourself? Word language, and written language in particular is mendacious. The meaning a writer wishes to convey can be belied in their words, and those words in turn can differ inside the mind of the reader. When one finds themselves at a sensory restriction in active conversation like the one found in chat messaging, this gap exacerbates itself.</p>
