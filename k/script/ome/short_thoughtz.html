<br>I’m only surmising but I’ve come to think that women’s deodorant might be laced
with hormones. I haven’t left my house in over three weeks and I’ve been out of
deodorant for even an even longer period of time, so I’ve been borrowing my
mother’s ever since. I don’t enjoy showering or water in general insofar that I
have to touch it with my body other than for consumption which has led me to a
modus operandi of masking my natural scent with deodorant. Funnily enough, it’s
also the reason why I’ve ran out and have now resorted to using my mother’s
basement stockpile. I would prefer to not return to men’s deodorant, the flowery
scent of women’s is greatly more tolerable when applied to one’s full body.
However, it has appeared to me that my pecs have been getting bigger ever since.
This could be attributed to the fact that I do over 300 pushups per day inbetween
my programming sessions for automating tasks that I will most likely carry out
only once in my life, but I think this line of thought is somewhat contrived
because of my naturally lithe figure, see also pics. Could this be an effect of
the deodorant? Replies are greatly appreciated.

<br>Excerpt from Ostentation & Desperate Love Vol. 3:
<br>
<br>“Got with a sixteen year-old girl in my early twenties, easiest way to select and
fuck a supple bitch with questionable self-respect. It’s the age where they still
haven’t diven down into a state of total lechery, given that you find the average,
impressionable girl. What I mean is the not-so-coy yet a little shy in her
expression type, the type that fits in with the general clique yet has one or more
specific interests or hobbies she devotes her time to, before that too fades away
with age. Girls like that take genuine interest in you once you’ve gotten ahold
of them, so it’s best to keep up appearances. Helped her with her maths homework.
Tried to impress her a little with my knowledge. Told her to use the squeeze
theorem -and that’s when I groped her breasts. Told her to use l’Hôpital’s rule
-and that’s when I smashed in her temples.”
</p>

<br>“When I got home, they’d ask me about the conflict, “Hey Ghast, why do you keep
doing it man? Haven’t you gotten enough experience?” And that’s what they don’t
understand. It’s what they don’t understand, that once you’re 30 chunks deep in
Mike Charlie and they’re enderpearling in gung ho steves who couldn’t give a flying
fuck if the creeps on their 9 turn the block FUBAR in mere moments, you’ve got
an ate-up jarhead breathing down your ass’ tailpipe on a November Golf minetrack
while you’re trying to get UHF on the line for a sitrep on testificate, there
aren’t any tables to book the damn exp on since it’s all been MIA for the last
200k ticks and could very well be with Jody too if you take QM’s word for it.
Even if we were filled with exp up to farlands at o dark thirty, we still couldn’t
use it - which is why I walked with a smile on my skin and didn’t say a goddamn word.”

<strong><u>driftking</u></strong>
<br>Hey, that bit about beating you up, that’s just my own silly imagination, I like
to wrestle and it’s fun to imagine a girl who actually stands a chance. But just
like how I could imagine that act of wrestling, I could also imagine taking you
to the ice skating track I visit from time to time, usually with friends. I think
it’s still open. It’s very nice, I think it’s about 200m. Though I’m not a
particularly skilled skater, I really enjoy casually making laps and talking about
whatever’s on my mind. For example: the Fast Furious films. Those films are actually
killer. Huge franchise that makes little sense in writing and probably even less so
in execution, but it’s great. The fourth film decided to shift the narrative from
street racers getting involved in grand theft auto to high-profile underworld crew
partaking in highly extravagant and illegal activities. Aside from Vin Diesel having
a hilarious character and Paul Walker being unable to act genuinely angry, there
isn’t much of interest to specifically address other than the fact that the films
are self-aware.
<br>
<br>What however is interesting, is the glorious setup that appeared in the end scene
of FF6 to set a precedent for FF7, that referenced what happened in Tokyo Drift.
To summarise, a crew member from FF4 to FF6, who was originally introduced in TD
- which is undoubtedly the wackiest FF film of the lot and could nearly be considered
a spin-off - acted as the mentor of TD’s main character, but then got killed in a
mysterious accident at the end of the film, which left the main character by himself.
Tokyo Drift is unrelated to any of the other FF films aside from this crew member.
At the end of FF6, we actually get to see this crew member die in the very same
accident whilst also revealing its true nature, which sets as stated before the
precedent for the seventh film. This took nine years. They took TD’s weirdest plot
shift and fixed it nine years later. Amazing. Anyway, once we’re done ice skating
and talking about Vin Diesel, I take you home. I even take the effort to pretty
much walk you to your doorstep, to which you remark “Haha I don’t have to be walked
here” to which I reply, “Walkdhur? Walker, did you just say Paul Walker?” and I
burst into rage and beat you up.

<strong><u>tenshi_no_tamag</u></strong>
<br>After watching Tenshi no Tamago (I’m a gnostic theist by the way but that aside),
I realised that many of its motives can be represented as an allegory for circumstances
in my own life. You see, I’ve always felt distant towards the world, feeling like
its eventual death or my own one are empty and meaningless. Yet while I am here,
I’m wandering within a sea of people that do not understand me, that do not care
for me. The film’s marine animal symbolism and theme of Noah’s ark cover this almost
perfectly, it’s practically imagery from my mind, which is weird, because I didn’t
remember loaning my cranium to some Japanese people (ha ha!) With that being said,
I really do identify myself with the white-haired, mysterious protagonist, who
presents himself to the little girl by riding along on a column of countless churning
machinery. It’s a beautiful scene, I must have watched it over a dozen times already.
This is what brings me to the focal point of my deconstruction: her. She’s spotless,
glittering yet plain, absolutely breathtaking. I would do anything for her, if she
let me. This girl directly represents the only woman I’ve ever felt true love for.
When she first entered middle school I was already a senior. And just like my hero,
I persuaded her. This is probably where some of you will speak of thematic incongruence
in my story. That word is one of my neologisms, for those that are interested.
The clash lies in the fact that while the male protagonist intended to break the
girl’s egg to face the consequences it would have for the world, I merely acted
out of a burst of romantic feelings. Feelings that got me registered as a sex offender.
Anyway, it’s a really good film, you should all watch it.

<strong><u>airhead</u></strong>
<br>Actually, I have managed to inject my erectile tissue with helium before. I’ve
devised two different ways of carrying out the procedure, each with its own experimental
setup. Both make use of a pressure difference between the tissue - and subsequently
its blood vessels - and the space surrounding it. The first setup is akin to a typical
pressure chamber; the air around the penis has helium gas added to it, whilst being
in a confined area. Obviously, just securing one’s penis inside this box-like contraption
wouldn’t do much with the sole addition of helium, or any other gas to begin with:
it’s imperative to perforate the tissue first, no deeper than the surface layer. I
recommend sustaining the procedure for about two hours, at a reasonably low pressure
of 2 bar. The second method is much more somatic: instead of pressurising the air
around one’s penis, one instead secures the urethra opening, after having placed a
tube inside it; with this method, one needs much fewer supplies and preparation.
Glue suffices. One point of interest however is that the urethra too requires some
‘breathable’ surface, this can be tended to with simple equipment, a paperclip is
a suitable option. Other than that, the remainder of the setup is equivalent to the
first one. I have experimented both methods on myself and - while I can’t speak of
it’s true effectiveness- I can say that I felt much more lighter afterwards.
</p>

<p>
<strong><u>mysteries_of_the_erudite</u></strong>
<br>I always wanted to know the tricks the dastardly old coot had up his sleeve, seemed
to be the stuff of legends if you asked me. Followed him into the usual alley, codger
frequents a damn cigar shop, but hey, you’re alone and retired, what else to do with
your money than to drink and smoke it away on expensive rubbish. He must have gotten
wind of my interests, because as soon as he caught a glimpse of my face, he bolted.
I didn’t intend to, of course, but I sometimes phase out momentarily. Been like that
ever since I played that last one. Horrible stuff, but the breast-laden fanservice
proved to be too much for my mind to methodically take apart. This man however has
endured, and with it many other games as well. I suppose I’m too well known at gatherings
now, that even a closeted veteran like him would recognise me. Pathetic. I lost his
tracks that day too. Did manage to persuade some of his retinue though to give me an
address. Waited for hours on end, managed to finally catch him by surprise after he
entered through the front door. I praised the sly bastard for his magnificent collection,
which obviously wasn’t my reason for talking to him. I then continued: “Truly fascinating,
how you seem to have played everything. Therefore, it must not come as a shock that
I wish to ask you this: is G Sanjou No Maou a promising VN that has been blinded by
its own infantile and perverse motives, which prevent any grittiness of the story to
be beyond amateurish?” “Is this a loaded question,” he replied, to which I responded
“In more ways than you can think of, professor,” as I tore away my sakura-patterned
kimono to reveal a contraption of nambu pistols placed in parallel.
</p>

<p>
<strong><u>commencement</u></strong>
<br>My strength is unparalleled. I literally have a fist that is beyond god, beyond
reason. If you poured gasoline on me and set me aflame, nothing would happen to me.
The gasoline will be consumed, and I will be standing, unharmed, yet the fire is
still burning. This is the fire that truly symbolises the power that I hold. I will
destroy you and tear you through this universe into another one and so on until the
very concept of time is but a mere transient moment in the process of your suffering.
How dare you insult her, you’re unworthy to have her as a girlfriend.
</p>

<p>
<strong><u>epoque</u></strong>
<br>Frankly, I’m not like the others. Insofar they are flowing along with the stream
of life, I’m the one who faces it head on. I got blasted with a water cannon at
a protest once. Did I believe what futile cause they supported - I most certainly
did not. Cretins and proletarian wastrels, flatter and enamour them, grist of the
mill. I’d like to refer to the word ‘epoque’. It’s a French term which in modern
usage denotes a period in which events of historical significance took place. I
disagree. Epoque is made aware in those who bear its procession. Historical events
are experienced, codified in a sphere of mind, yet when we speak of epoque as how
it’s commonly known, it is merely identified in a grid of mechanistic contrivances.
I MAKE epoque. How bare you lay upon me when you do my bidding.
</p>

<p>
<strong><u>girlfriend_trials</u></strong>
<br>If you wish to walk my path you will have to pass and survive three trials.
<br>
<br>Trial number one: You will undergo sensory deprivation for five hours. When these
five hours are over, you will be notified through siren, yet since you have been
deprived of your senses, there is no way for you to figure out. That’s right, you
will need to escape. You should be able to realise that your right arm isn’t fixed
properly, thus allowing you to break free with that arm. You should also be able
to remove the veil which has been placed over your eyes. On the table where your
right arm rests, a New Nintendo 3DS XL is placed proudly, it is my personal console;
please don’t break the New Nintendo 3DS XL. When you turn on the New Nintendo 3DS XL,
you will be greeted by a custom vaporwave loadscreen. Whether you gasp in awe at this
or not is your own choice, I don’t think it will affect further scoring. Anyway, your
task is to fire up Nintendogs and make my puppies respond to your voice. I bet you
will soon find out that this is an impossible task. Oh, but what was that? The five
hours are over and the siren is clamoring across the premises. The puppies responded!
Ahahaha, I made them so that they would respond to the siren, aren’t I silly, off to
the next trial you go.
<br>
<br>Trial number two: for this trial I want you to relax, take a deep breath. Your clothes
are on the chair positioned across the table. Black pleated skirt, white blouse with
a faint flowery motif, a beige woolen jumper if you’re cold but I sincerely doubt
that. Keep the jumper anyway if you like it, it’s my gift to you. Exit the room, step
out into the foyer and tell me where you are; this is the heartfelt & emotional part
of the trial. I am laying on my back on the grand piano nearby, take a seat on the
stool. I implore you to take a seat. Did you tell me where you are yet? Do you know?
No? Guess you failed this trial then - ahahaha, I’m merely kidding, I’m such a tease.
Hey, by the way, you get fourty seconds to run back to the room and get my FUCKING
New Nintendo 3DS XL to me, you filthy slut, I want to check on my Nintendogs NOW.
<br>
<br>Trial number three, the final trial: I jump up from the piano, ever elegant, and give
the signal. KRRRR, BOOOM. A cage is lowered and dropped around us. The final trial,
the final frontier, rock hard, solid, visceral, bilateral, unyielding & with a severly
pugnacious aura filled combat. If you wish, if you so desire to be my girlfriend I
want you to be able to withstand me mano-a-girlfriendo. Honestly, that would be unfair,
I’ve been twirling karambits around my fingers whilst juggling hook swords and my gi
has its arm sleeves ripped off. My fiery chaos blazes like a titan. So I’m going to
give you an unique opportunity: if you can resist a mere single blow, I will love you
forever and ever and you will receive everything from me that I can provide. This is
where the punch line hits - ahaha, get it? I know this little technique that I like to
call ‘insidious parasite’. It’s a palm strike I have derived from extensive training
in wing chun for what must have been over two decades. As soon as it hits your chest,
the reverberating shock will set off an eigenfrequency which causes your skin to scald,
your blood to boil and your bones to grind to dust. It is an absolute death sentence,
no way to live through it, I’m just that strong - unless? Unless you have something
which would dampen the blow, rendering it useless. All that springs to mind is an ample
bosom, yes, decidedly so. The only way you will live through the final trial is if you
have huge tits. I Need My Girlfriend To Have Huge Tits No Matter What.

<br>I’m That Pussy Bitch Prince Lich Lord And Frankly, I’m Just Going To Obliterate
You
<br>
<br>Let’s talk fantasy. Doesn’t matter what you had in mind, it’s fantasy. You’re
just yourself, idealised version of yourself perhaps. Me? I’m The Gaunt Overture
of The Will To Power & Portend of The Effulgent End; a lich more powerful than
the likes of you could ever imagine. I’m really, really old, so old in fact that
it makes little difference whether you’re a cute little loli bitch or a possibly
voluptuous regular bitch. I’M A LICH, BABY. You walk into my sanctum and I
appear before you in my monstrous, skeletal but strangely organic form, solid,
rigid and tight as fuck. My spiked armour glistens with lymph. And here is where
you die: underneath my breastplate I have situated my previous forced girlfriend
oh I love her so much but her lifeless body provides me with no more respite
from the inane thoughts that plague my mind therefore I cast corpse explosion on
her, causing said breastplate to shoot off from my statuesque figure straight
into your body. You’re dead now, you’ve been impaled thoroughly. Right through
your supple breasts too, that’s called marksmanship, baby. And here is where you
live: My incredibly ancient lich form marches toward your now likewise lifeless
body and after cupping your adorable cheeks, I violently pull my breastplate off
your corpse. Finally, I make use of my necromantic powers, causing your body to
convulse as you scream out in the pain that was imprinted upon you when I killed
you mere moments ago. Hey cutie welcome back. Before you can utter a word which
isn’t solely composed of shrill shrieks, I burn every inch of clothing off your
body and twirl you around, getting a good look at you. Ahahahaha, no, that
absolutely will not do. Look, you’re very attractive, very alluring, you can
tell me all about your interests and pursuits later, okay? Before we get to
that, I have to fleshshape you up a tiny bit. What is fleshshaping, you ask?
It’s an unambiguous term, it’s the technique in which I sear your bones to dust
and use your flesh as a catalyst to recreate your likeness in the form of a
homunculus, which obviously allows me to incite some changes, such as making
your spirit swear fealty to me, increasing your resilience for the sake of not
having to completely revive you after I beat you up a little, perhaps shifting
your bodily features whenever I feel like it, the usual ideas. Now that we have
you all lovely and bound to me, you can take a peek at the wardrobes in Section
C1 of the sanctum, lots of clothes for you to pick and wear as you see fit. Wow,
you’ve returned so soon, excellent. And here is where you get fucked: I
transform myself from my terrifying lich form into my breathtakingly handsome
human form, which also shows a couple of bony segments and magic runes as a lazy
reminder that I’m still a lich. Look, I’m not a human, okay? I’m a lich which
means I’m really old, incomparably old to you. I throw you onto the enchanted
bed and plow you into submission, which, considering you were already obedient
to me, is incredibly submissive. How precious and weak you are, my young, feeble
girl.

<strong><u>prince_beautiful</u></strong>
<br>Prince Beautiful enters the stage. The crowd puts their hands together in
composed rhythm. When the clapping has subsided, he takes off his suit jacket
and throws it towards the audience. Faint mumurs of unease can be heard. He
takes a permanent marker and draws a crude shape resembling a crescent moon on
his shirt. A few members of the crowd let out snickers and faint laughter. He
calls fourteen-year-old Elise from the audience to the stage. The crowd is
equally confused as amused. He walks up to her, grabs her by the back of her
head and pulls out a letter opener from his right back pocket, stabbing her in
the abdomen. Her cries of anguish are overshadowed by the roaring of the crowd.
He cups her cheeks and forcibly makes out with her, after which he slams her
quivering body against the stage, kicking her behind the curtain. The crowd’s
excitement can no longer keep them contained to their seats. Two weeks pass.
Prince Beautiful pulls back the curtain, revealing her abandoned corpse. The
theatre is dead silent.

<br>and thats when i take a leave off my job, spend a lot of money on a private investigator, track her down and chart my route to visit her, 8 years from now. i will be leaning against a brick wall, my muscles so turgid you wouldn’t even believe it was me from back then. bubblegum blowing, doing knife tricks whilst slicing an apple, i tilt my head 60 degrees to the left and eye her thouroughly as she exits her workplace building. “hey, from back then, still recognise me? remember me??” and she will look at me puzzled for a moment before ignoring me and going on her way again like I was some kind of common street rat trying to get a rise out of her

Personally I’ve been living in a constant state of agony and terror since 2015 because yeah my internet girlfriend could get a real boyfriend any second now
<br>these days I just try to introduce conversational topics with her in the hopes that we can we have fun like we used to, but she just gives me occasional, short replies that seem like they’re only sent to make me refrain from asking why she ignores me
<br>Yeah I create elaborate setups of jokes in my head, trying to be as funny as possible in a multitude of situations…..
<br>guess I’m just waiting for that laughing emoji
<br>aren’t we all huh
<br>She’s like a 6 at best by the way but I remember how she used to laugh at my jokes so much and because I’m deprived of attention and am too insecure to approach women in real life I just fall in love with any girl that is nice to me
