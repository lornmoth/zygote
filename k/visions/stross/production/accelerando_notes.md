   Experiments in digitizing and running neural wetware under
   emulation are well established; some radical libertarians claim
   that, as the technology matures, death - with its draconian
   curtailment of property and voting rights - will become the biggest
   civil rights issue of all.

   Progress is expected to speed up shortly, as the fundamental patents in genomic engineering begin to expire; the Free Chromosome Foundation has already published a manifesto calling for the creation of an intellectual-property-free genome with improved replacements for all commonly defective exons.

 "I think I need to report a crime," he
 tells Monica - or whoever is plugged into Monica's head right now,
 because now he knows where he is and who he was meant to meet
 (although not why) - and he understands that, for the Franklin
 Collective, identity is a politically loaded issue.

 "A crime report." Her expression is subtly mocking. "Identity theft,
 by any chance?"

 "Yeah, yeah, I know: Identity is theft, don't trust anyone whose state
 vector hasn't forked for more than a gigasecond, change is the only
 constant, et bloody cetera. Who am I talking to, by the way? And if
 we're talking, doesn't that signify that you think we're on the same
 side, more or less?" He struggles to sit up in the recliner chair:
 Stepper motors whine softly as it strives to accommodate him.

 "Sidedness is optional." The woman who is Monica some of the time
 looks at him quirkily: "It tends to alter drastically if you vary the
 number of dimensions.

 "One person, one vote, is obsolete," says Alan. "The broader issue of
 how we value identity needs to be revisited, the franchise
 reconsidered. Do you get one vote for each warm body? Or one vote for
 each sapient individual? What about distributed intelligences? The
 proposals in the Equal Rights Act are deeply flawed, based on a cult
 of individuality that takes no account of the true complexity of
 posthumanism."

"You're going to school, and that's that."

 Her mother is a blonde ice maiden madonna, one of the IRS's most
 productive bounty hunters - she can make grown CEOs panic just by
 blinking at them. Amber, a towheaded-eight-year old tearaway with a
 confusing mix of identities, inexperience blurring the boundary
 between self and grid, is not yet able to fight back effectively.
 After a couple of seconds, she verbalizes a rather feeble protest:
 "Don't want to!" One of her stance daemons whispers that this is the
 wrong approach to take, so she modifies it: "They'll beat up on me,
 Mom. I'm too different. Sides, I know you want me socialized up with
 my grade metrics, but isn't that what sideband's for? I can socialize
 real good at home."

 Mom does something unexpected: She kneels, putting herself on
 eye-level with Amber. They're on the living room carpet, all
 seventies-retro brown corduroy and acid-orange Paisley wallpaper, and
 for once, they're alone: The domestic robots are in hiding while the
 humans hold court. "Listen to me, sweetie." Mom's voice is breathy,
 laden with an emotional undertow as strong and stifling as the
 eau-de-Cologne she wears to the office to cover up the scent of her
 client's fear. "I know that's what your father's writing to you, but
 it isn't true. You need the company - physical company - of children
 your own age. You're natural, not some kind of engineered freak, even
 with your skullset. Natural children like you need company or they
 grow up all weird. Socialization isn't just about texting your own
 kind, Amber, you need to know how to deal with people who're
 different, too. I want you to grow up happy, and that won't happen if
 you don't learn to get on with children your own age. You're not going
 to be some kind of cyborg otaku freak, Amber. But to get healthy,
 you've got to go to school, build up a mental immune system. Anyway,
 that which does not destroy us makes us stronger, right?"

 It's crude moral blackmail, transparent as glass and manipulative as
 hell, but Amber's corpus logica flags it with a heavy emotional sprite
 miming the likelihood of physical discipline if she rises to the bait:
 Mom is agitated, nostrils slightly flared, ventilation rate up, some
 vasodilatation visible in her cheeks. Amber - in combination with her
 skullset and the metacortex of distributed agents it supports - is
 mature enough at eight years to model, anticipate, and avoid corporal
 punishment. But her stature and lack of physical maturity conspire to
 put her at a disadvantage when negotiating with adults who matured in
 a simpler age. She sighs, then puts on a pout to let Mom know she's
 still reluctant, but obedient. "O-kay. If you say so."

 "My grandparents?" Amber stifles a snort. "Mom's parents are dead.
 Dad's are still alive, but they won't talk to him - they like Mom.
 They think I'm creepy. I know little things, their tax bands and
 customer profiles. I could mine data with my head when I was four. I'm
 not built like little girls were in their day, and they don't
 understand. You know the old ones don't like us at all? Some of the
 churches make money doing nothing but exorcisms for oldsters who think
 their kids are possessed."

 Amber's avatar looks about sixteen,
 with disheveled blonde hair and enhanced cheekbones. It's a lie, of
 course, because in subjective life experience, she's in her
 mid-twenties, but apparent age signifies little in a simulation space
 populated by upload minds, or in real space, where post-humans age at
 different rates.

The destination lies nearly
   three light-years from Earth, and even with high acceleration and
   relativistic cruise speeds, the one-kilogram starwhisp and its
   hundred-kilogram light sail will take the best part of seven years
   to get there. Sending a human-sized probe is beyond even the vast
   energy budget of the new orbital states in Jupiter system -
   near-lightspeed travel is horrifically expensive. Rather than a
   big, self-propelled ship with canned primates for passengers, as
   previous generations had envisaged, the starship is a
   Coke-can-sized slab of nanocomputers, running a neural simulation
   of the uploaded brain states of some tens of humans at merely
   normal speed. By the time its occupants beam themselves home again
   for download into freshly cloned bodies, a linear extrapolation
   shows that as much change will have overtaken human civilization as
   in the preceding fifty millennia - the sum total of H. sapiens
   sapiens' time on Earth.

 "Hell, yeah. There's a singularity going on, that implies
 disequilibrium. An' wherever there's a disequilibrium, someone is
 going to get rich disassembling the leftovers. Listen, I once knew
 this econo-economist, that's what he was. Worked for the Eurofeds,
 rubber fetishist. He tole me about this fact'ry near Barcelona. It had
 a disassembly line running in it. Spensive servers in boxes'd roll in
 at one end. Be unpacked. Then workers'd take the cases off, strip the
 disk drives, memory, processors, bits'n'guts out. Bag and tag job.
 Throw the box, what's left, 'cause it wasn't worth dick. Thing is, the
 manufact'rer charged so much for parts, it was worth their while to
 buy whole machines'n'strip them. To bits. And sell the bits. Hell,
 they got an enterprise award for ingenuity! All 'cause they knew that
 disassembly was the wave of the future."

 Amber finds the Slug browsing quietly in a transparent space filled
 with lazily waving branches that resemble violet coral fans. They're a
 ghost-memory of alien life, an order of thermophilic quasi fungi with
 hyphae ridged in actin/myosin analogues, muscular and slippery filter
 feeders that eat airborne unicellular organisms. The Slug itself is
 about two meters long and has a lacy white exoskeleton of curves and
 arcs that don't repeat, disturbingly similar to a Penrose tiling.
 Chocolate brown organs pulse slowly under the skeleton. The ground
 underfoot is dry but feels swampy.

 Actually, the Slug is a surgical disguise. Both it and the
 quasi-fungal ecosystem have been extinct for millions of years,
 existing only as cheap stage props in an interstellar medicine show
 run by rogue financial instruments. The Slug itself is one such
 self-aware scam, probably a pyramid scheme or even an entire
 compressed junk bond market in heavy recession, trying to hide from
 its creditors by masquerading as a life-form.
