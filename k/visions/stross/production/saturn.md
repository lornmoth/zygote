 If you are remembering this presentation, you are probably
 resimulated. This is not the same as being resurrected. You may
 remember dying. Do not worry: Like all your other memories, it is a
 fabrication. In fact, this is the first time you have ever been alive.
 (Exception: If you died after the singularity, you may be a genuine
 resurrectee. In which case, why are you reading this FAQ?)

 How you got here:

 The center of the solar system - Mercury, Venus, Earth's Moon, Mars,
 the asteroid belt, and Jupiter - have been dismantled, or are being
 dismantled, by weakly godlike intelligences. [NB: Monotheistic clergy
 and Europeans who remember living prior to 1600, see alternative
 memeplex "in the beginning."] A weakly godlike intelligence is not a
 supernatural agency, but the product of a highly advanced society that
 learned how to artificially create souls [late 20th century: software]
 and translate human minds into souls and vice versa. [Core concepts:
 Human beings all have souls. Souls are software objects. Software is
 not immortal.]

 Some of the weakly godlike intelligences appear to cultivate an
 interest in their human antecedents - for whatever reason is not
 known. (Possibilities include the study of history through
 horticulture, entertainment through live-action role-playing, revenge,
 and economic forgery.) While no definitive analysis is possible, all
 the resimulated persons to date exhibit certain common
 characteristics: They are all based on well-documented historical
 persons, their memories show suspicious gaps [see: smoke and mirrors],
 and they are ignorant of or predate the singularity [see: Turing
 Oracle, Vinge catastrophe].

 It is believed that the weakly godlike agencies have created you as a
 vehicle for the introspective study of your historical antecedent by
 backward-chaining from your corpus of documented works, and the
 back-projected genome derived from your collateral descendants, to
 generate an abstract description of your computational state vector.
 This technique is extremely intensive [see: expTime-complete
 algorithms^[], Turing Oracle, time travel, industrial magic] but
 marginally plausible in the absence of supernatural explanations.

 After experiencing your life, the weakly godlike agencies have
 expelled you. For reasons unknown, they chose to do this by
 transmitting your upload state and genome/proteome complex to
 receivers owned and operated by a consortium of charities based on
 Saturn. These charities have provided for your basic needs, including
 the body you now occupy.

 In summary: You are a reconstruction of someone who lived and died a
 long time ago, not a reincarnation. You have no intrinsic moral right
 to the identity you believe to be your own, and an extensive body of
 case law states that you do not inherit your antecedent's possessions.
 Other than that, you are a free individual.

 Note that fictional resimulation is strictly forbidden. If you have
 reason to believe that you may be a fictional character, you must
 contact the city immediately. [see: James Bond, Spider Jerusalem.]
 Failure to comply is a felony.

 Where you are:

 You are on Saturn. Saturn is a gas giant planet 120,500 kilometers in
 diameter, located 1.5 billion kilometers from Earth's sun. [NB:
 Europeans who remember living prior to 1580, see alternative memeplex
 "the flat Earth - not".] Saturn has been partially terraformed by
 posthuman emigrants from Earth and Jupiter orbit: The ground beneath
 your feet is, in reality, the floor of a hydrogen balloon the size of
 a continent, floating in Saturn's upper atmosphere. [NB: Europeans who
 remember living prior to 1790, internalize the supplementary memeplex:
 "the Brothers Montgolfier."] The balloon is very safe, but mining
 activities and the use of ballistic weapons are strongly deprecated
 because the air outside is unbreathable and extremely cold.

 The society you have been instantiated in is extremely wealthy within
 the scope of Economics 1.0, the value transfer system developed by
 human beings during and after your own time. Money exists, and is used
 for the usual range of goods and services, but the basics - food,
 water, air, power, off-the-shelf clothing, housing, historical
 entertainment, and monster trucks - are free. An implicit social
 contract dictates that, in return for access to these facilities, you
 obey certain laws.

 If you wish to opt out of this social contract, be advised that other
 worlds may run Economics 2.0 or subsequent releases. These
 value-transfer systems are more efficient - hence wealthier - than
 Economics 1.0, but true participation in Economics 2.0 is not possible
 without dehumanizing cognitive surgery. Thus, in absolute terms,
 although this society is richer than any you have ever heard of, it is
 also a poverty-stricken backwater compared to its neighbors.

 Things you should avoid doing:

 Many activities that have been classified as crimes in other societies
 are legal here. These include but are not limited to: acts of worship,
 art, sex, violence, communication, or commerce between consenting
 competent sapients of any species, except where such acts transgress
 the list of prohibitions below. [See additional memeplex: competence
 defined.]

 Some activities are prohibited here and may have been legal in your
 previous experience. These include willful deprivation of ability to
 consent [see: slavery], interference in the absence of consent [see:
 minors, legal status of], formation of limited liability companies
 [see: singularity], and invasion of defended privacy [see: the Slug,
 Cognitive Pyramid Schemes, Brain Hacking, Thompson Trust Exploit].

 Some activities unfamiliar to you are highly illegal and should be
 scrupulously avoided. These include: possession of nuclear weapons,
 possession of unlimited autonomous replicators [see: gray goo],
 coercive assimilationism [see: borganism, aggressive], coercive
 halting of Turing-equivalent personalities [see: basilisks], and
 applied theological engineering [see: God bothering].

 Some activities superficially familiar to you are merely stupid and
 should be avoided for your safety, although they are not illegal as
 such. These include: giving your bank account details to the son of
 the Nigerian Minister of Finance; buying title to bridges,
 skyscrapers, spacecraft, planets, or other real assets; murder;
 selling your identity; and entering into financial contracts with
 entities running Economics 2.0 or higher.

 Things you should do as soon as possible:

 Many material artifacts you may consider essential to life are freely
 available - just ask the city, and it will grow you clothes, a house,
 food, or other basic essentials. Note, however, that the library of
 public domain structure templates is of necessity restrictive, and
 does not contain items that are highly fashionable or that remain in
 copyright. Nor will the city provide you with replicators, weapons,
 sexual favors, slaves, or zombies.

 You are advised to register as a citizen as soon as possible. If the
 individual you are a resimulation of can be confirmed dead, you may
 adopt their name but not - in law - any lien or claim on their
 property, contracts, or descendants. You register as a citizen by
 asking the city to register you; the process is painless and typically
 complete within four hours. Unless you are registered, your legal
 status as a sapient organism may be challenged. The ability to request
 citizenship rights is one of the legal tests for sapience, and failure
 to comply may place you in legal jeopardy. You can renounce your
 citizenship whenever you wish: This may be desirable if you emigrate
 to another polity.

 While many things are free, it is highly likely that you posses no
 employable skills, and therefore, no way of earning money with which
 to purchase unfree items. The pace of change in the past century has
 rendered almost all skills you may have learned obsolete [see:
 singularity]. However, owing to the rapid pace of change, many
 cooperatives, trusts, and guilds offer on-the-job training or
 educational loans.

 Your ability to learn depends on your ability to take information in
 the format in which it is offered. Implants are frequently used to
 provide a direct link between your brain and the intelligent machines
 that surround it. A basic core implant set is available on request
 from the city. [See: implant security, firewall, wetware.]

 Your health is probably good if you have just been reinstantiated, and
 is likely to remain good for some time. Most diseases are curable, and
 in event of an incurable ailment or injury, a new body may be provided
 - for a fee. (In event of your murder, you will be furnished with a
 new body at the expense of your killer.) If you have any preexisting
 medical conditions or handicaps, consult the city.

 The city is an agoric-annealing participatory democracy with a limited
 liability constitution. Its current executive agency is a weakly
 godlike intelligence that chooses to associate with human-equivalent
 intelligences: This agency is colloquially known as "Hello Kitty,"
 "Beautiful Cat," or "Aineko," and may manifest itself in a variety of
 physical avatars if corporeal interaction is desired. (Prior to the
 arrival of "Hello Kitty," the city used a variety of human-designed
 expert systems that provided suboptimal performance.)

 The city's mission statement is to provide a mediatory environment for
 human-equivalent intelligences and to preserve same in the face of
 external aggression. Citizens are encouraged to participate in the
 ongoing political processes of determining such responses. Citizens
 also have a duty to serve on a jury if called (including senatorial
 service), and to defend the city.

 Where to go for further information:

 Until you have registered as a citizen and obtained basic implants,
 all further questions should be directed to the city. Once you have
 learned to use your implants, you will not need to ask this question.
