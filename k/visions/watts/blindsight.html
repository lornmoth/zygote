It didn't start out here.  Not with the scramblers or <I>Rorschach</I>,
not with Big Ben or <I>Theseus</I> or the vampires.  Most people
would say it started with the Fireflies, but they'd be wrong.  It
<I>ended</I> with all those things.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
For me, it began with Robert Paglino.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
At the age of eight, he was my best and only friend.  We were fellow
outcasts, bound by complementary misfortune.  Mine was developmental.
 His was genetic:  an uncontrolled genotype that left him predisposed
to nearsightedness, acne, and (as it later turned out) a
susceptibility to narcotics.    His parents had never had him
optimized.  Those few TwenCen relics who still believed in God also
held that one shouldn't try to improve upon His handiwork.  So
although both of us <I>could</I> have been repaired, only one of us
<I>had</I> been.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I arrived at the playground to find Pag the center of attention for
some half-dozen kids, those lucky few in front punching him in the
head, the others making do with taunts of <I>mongrel</I> and <I>polly</I>
while waiting their turn.  I watched him raise his arms, almost
hesitantly, to ward off the worst of the blows.  I could see into his
head better than I could see into my own; he was scared that his
attackers might think those hands were coming up to hit <I>back</I>,
that they'd read it as an act of defiance and hurt him even more.
Even then, at the tender age of eight and with half my mind gone, I
was becoming a superlative observer.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
But I didn't know what to do.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I hadn't seen much of Pag lately.  I was pretty sure he'd been
avoiding me.  Still, when your best friend's in trouble you help out,
right?  Even if the odds are impossible-and how many
eight-year-olds would go up against six bigger kids for a sandbox
buddy?-at least you call for backup.  Flag a sentry.
<I>Something</I>.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I just stood there.  I didn't even especially <I>want</I> to help
him.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
That didn't make sense.  Even if he hadn't been my best friend, I
should at least have empathized.  I'd suffered less than Pag in the
way of overt violence; my seizures tended to keep the other kids at a
distance, scared <I>them</I> even as they incapacitated <I>me</I>.
Still.  I was no stranger to the taunts and insults, or the foot that
appears from nowhere to trip you up en route from A to B.  I knew how
that felt.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Or I had, once.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
But that part of me had been cut out along with the bad wiring.  I
was still working up the algorithms to get it back, still learning by
observation.  Pack animals always tear apart the weaklings in their
midst.  Every child knows that much instinctively.  Maybe I should
just let that process unfold, maybe I shouldn't try to mess with
nature.  Then again,  Pag's parents hadn't messed with nature, and
look what it got them:  a son curled up in the dirt while a bunch of
engineered superboys kicked in his ribs.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
In the end, propaganda worked where empathy failed.  Back then I
didn't so much think as observe, didn't deduce so much as
<I>remember</I>-and what I remembered was a thousand
inspirational stories lauding anyone who ever stuck up for the
underdog.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
So I picked up a rock the size of my fist and hit two of Pag's
assailants across the backs of their heads before anyone even knew I
was in the game.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
A third, turning to face the new threat, took a blow to the face that
audibly crunched the bones of his cheek.  I remember wondering why I
didn't take any satisfaction from that sound, why it meant nothing
beyond the fact I had one less opponent to worry about.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The rest of them ran at the sight of blood.  One of the braver
promised me I was dead, shouted &quot;<I>Fucking zombie!</I>&quot;
over his shoulder as he disappeared around the corner.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Three decades it took, to see the irony in that remark.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Two of the enemy twitched at my feet.  I kicked one in the head until
it stopped moving, turned to the other.  Something grabbed my arm and
I swung without thinking, without <I>looking</I> until Pag yelped and
ducked out of reach.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Oh,&quot; I said.  &quot;Sorry.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
One thing lay motionless.  The other moaned and held its head and
curled up in a ball.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Oh<I> shit</I>,&quot; Pag panted.  Blood coursed unheeded from
his nose and splattered down his shirt.  His cheek was turning blue
and yellow.  &quot;Oh<I> shit </I>oh shit oh <I>shit...</I>&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I thought of something to say.  &quot;You all right?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Oh <I>shit</I>, you-I mean, you <I>never</I>...&quot;  He
wiped his mouth.  Blood smeared the back of his hand. &quot;Oh <I>man</I>
are we in trouble.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;They started it.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Yeah, but you-I mean, <I>look</I> at them!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The moaning thing was crawling away on all fours.  I wondered how
long it would be before it found reinforcements.  I wondered if I
should kill it before then.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;You'da <I>never</I> done that before,&quot; Pag said.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Before the operation, he meant.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I actually did feel something then-faint, distant, but
unmistakable.  I felt angry.  &quot;They <I>started</I>-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Pag backed away, eyes wide.  &quot;What are you <I>doing</I>? Put
that <I>down</I>!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I'd raised my fists.  I didn't remember doing that.  I unclenched
them.  It took a while.  I had to look at my hands very hard for a
long, long time.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The rock dropped to the ground, blood-slick and glistening.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I was trying to help.&quot;  I didn't understand why he
couldn't <I>see </I>that.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;You're, you're not the <I>same</I>,&quot; Pag said from a safe
distance.  &quot;You're not even <I>Siri</I> any more.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

&quot;Only half.  For the ep-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I <I>know</I> for the epilepsy!  You think I don't know?  But
you were <I>in</I> that half-or, like, <I>part</I> of you
was...&quot;  He struggled with the words, with the concept behind
them.  &quot;And now you're <I>different</I>.  It's like, your mom
and dad <I>murdered</I> you-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;My mom and dad,&quot; I said, suddenly quiet, &quot;saved my
life.  I would have <I>died</I>.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I think you <I>did</I> die,&quot; said my best and only friend.
 &quot;I think <I>Siri</I> died, they scooped him out and threw him
away and you're some whole other kid that just, just <I>grew back</I>
out of what was left.  You're not the <I>same</I>.  Ever since.
You're not the <I>same</I>.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I still don't know if Pag really knew what he was saying.  Maybe his
mother had just pulled the plug on whatever game he'd been wired into
for the previous eighteen hours, forced him outside for some fresh
air.  Maybe, after fighting pod people in gamespace, he couldn't help
but see them everywhere.  Maybe.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
But you could make a case for what he said.  I do remember Helen
telling me (and <I>telling</I> me) how difficult it was to adjust.
<I>Like you had a whole new personality</I>, she said, and why not?
There's a reason they call it <I>radical</I> hemispherectomy:  half
the brain thrown out with yesterday's krill, the remaining half
press-ganged into double duty.  Think of all the rewiring that one
lonely hemisphere must have struggled with as it tried to take up the
slack.  It turned out okay, obviously.  The brain's a very flexible
piece of meat; it took some doing, but it adapted.  <I>I</I> adapted.
 Still.  Think of all that must have been squeezed out, deformed,
<I>reshaped</I> by the time the renovations were through.  You could
argue that I'm a different person than the one who used to occupy
this body.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The grownups showed up eventually, of course.  Medicine was bestowed,
ambulances called.  Parents were outraged, diplomatic volleys
exchanged, but it's tough to drum up neighborhood outrage on behalf
of your injured baby when playground surveillance from three angles
shows the little darling-and five of his buddies- kicking
in the ribs of a disabled boy.   My mother, for her part, recycled
the usual complaints about problem children and absentee fathers-Dad
was off again in some other hemisphere-but the dust settled
pretty quickly.  Pag and I even stayed friends, after a short hiatus
that reminded us both of the limited social prospects open to
schoolyard rejects who don't stick together.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
So I survived that and a million other childhood experiences.  I grew
up and I got along.  I learned to fit in.  I observed, recorded,
derived the algorithms and mimicked appropriate behaviors.  Not much
of it was-heartfelt, I guess the word is.  I had friends and
enemies, like everyone else.  I chose them by running through
checklists of behaviors and circumstances compiled from years of
observation.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I may have grown up distant but I grew up <I>objective</I>, and I
have Robert Paglino to thank for that.  His seminal observation set
everything in motion.  It led me into Synthesis, fated me to our
disastrous encounter with the Scramblers, spared me the worse fate
befalling Earth.  Or the better one, I suppose, depending on your
point of view.  Point of view <I>matters</I>:  I see that now, blind,
talking to myself, trapped in a coffin falling past the edge of the
solar system.  I see it for the first time since some beaten bloody
friend on a childhood battlefield convinced me to throw my own point
of view away.</P>

He may have been wrong.  <I>I</I> may have been.  But that, that
<I>distance</I>-that chronic sense of being an alien among your
own kind-it's not entirely a bad thing.

So we dragged ourselves back from the dead:  five part-time cadavers,
naked, emaciated, barely able to move even in zero gee.  We emerged
from our coffins like premature moths ripped from their cocoons,
still half-grub.  We were alone and off course and utterly helpless,
and it took a conscious effort to remember:  they would never have
risked our lives if we hadn't been essential.</P>

&quot;Morning, commissar.&quot;  Isaac Szpindel reached one
trembling, insensate hand for the feedback gloves at the base of his
pod.  Just past him, Susan James was curled into a loose fetal ball,
murmuring to herselves.  Only Amanda Bates, already dressed and
cycling through a sequence of bone-cracking isometrics,  possessed
anything approaching mobility.  Every now and then she tried bouncing
a rubber ball off the bulkhead; but not even she was up to catching
it on the rebound yet.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The journey had melted us down to a common archetype.  James' round
cheeks and hips, Szpindel's high forehead and lumpy, lanky
chassis-even the enhanced carboplatinum brick shit-house that
Bates used for a body- all had shriveled to the same desiccated
collection of sticks and bones.  Even our hair seemed to have become
strangely discolored during the voyage, although I knew that was
impossible.  More likely it was just filtering the pallor of the skin
beneath.  Still.  The pre-dead James had been dirty blond, Szpindel's
hair had been almost dark enough to call <I>black</I>- but the
stuff floating from their scalps looked the same dull kelpy brown to
me now.  Bates kept her head shaved, but even her eyebrows weren't as
rusty as I remembered them.</P>

If you did, of course-if you forgot appearance and watched for
motion, ignored meat and studied <I>topology</I>-you'd never
mistake one for another.  Every facial tic was a data point, every
conversational pause spoke volumes more than the words to either
side.  I could see James' personae shatter and coalesce in the
flutter of an eyelash.  Szpindel's unspoken distrust of Amanda Bates
shouted from the corner of his smile.  Every twitch of the phenotype
cried aloud to anyone who knew the language.</P>

She'd taken us a good fifteen AUs towards our destination before
something scared her off course.  Then she'd skidded north like a
startled cat and started climbing:  a wild high three-gee burn off
the ecliptic, thirteen hundred tonnes of momentum bucking against
Newton's First. She'd emptied her Penn tanks, bled dry her substrate
mass, squandered a hundred forty days' of fuel in hours.  Then a long
cold coast through the abyss, years of stingy accounting, the thrust
of every antiproton weighed against the drag of sieving it from the
void.  Teleportation isn't magic:  the Icarus stream couldn't send us
the actual antimatter it made, only the quantum specs.  <I>Theseus</I>
had to filterfeed the raw material from space, one ion at a time.
For long dark years she'd made do on pure inertia, hoarding every
swallowed atom.  Then a flip; ionizing lasers strafing the space
ahead; a ramscoop thrown wide in a hard brake.  The weight of a
trillion trillion protons slowed<I> </I>her down and refilled her gut
and flattened us all over again.  <I>Theseus</I> had burned
relentless until almost the moment of our resurrection.</P>

It was easy enough to retrace those steps; our course was there in
ConSensus for anyone to see.  Exactly why the ship had blazed that
trail was another matter.  Doubtless it would all come out during the
post-rez briefing.  We were hardly the first vessel to travel under
the cloak of <I>sealed orders</I>, and if there'd been a pressing
need to know by now we'd have known by now.  Still, I wondered who
had locked out the Comm logs.  Mission Control, maybe.  Or Sarasti.
Or <I>Theseus</I> herself, for that matter.  It was easy to forget
the Quantical AI at the heart of our ship.  It stayed so discreetly
in the background, nurtured and carried us and permeated our
existence like an unobtrusive God; but like God, it never took your

He'd given us four hours to come back.  It took more than three just
to get me out of the crypt.  By then my brain was at least firing on

Gravity-or any centripetal facsimile thereof-did not
appeal to me.  I set up my own tent in zero-gee and as far to stern
as possible, nuzzling the forward wall of the starboard shuttle tube.
 The tent inflated like an abscess on <I>Theseus'</I> spine, a little
climate-controlled bubble of atmosphere in the dark cavernous vacuum
beneath the ship's carapace.  My own effects were minimal; it took
all of thirty seconds to stick them to the wall, and another thirty
to program the tent's environment.</P>

Stern was closest, so I started there:  at the shielding that
separated payload from propulsion.  A single sealed hatch blistered
the aft bulkhead dead center.  Behind it, a service tunnel wormed
back through machinery best left untouched by human hands.  The fat
superconducting torus of the ramscoop ring; the antennae fan behind
it, unwound now into an indestructible soap-bubble big enough to
shroud a city, its face turned sunward to catch the faint quantum
sparkle of the Icarus antimatter stream.  More shielding behind that;
then the telematter reactor, where raw hydrogen and refined
information conjured fire three hundred times hotter than the sun's.
I knew the incantations, of course-antimatter cracking and
deconstruction, the teleportation of quantum serial numbers-but
it was still magic to me, how we'd come so far so fast.  It would
have been magic to anyone.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Except Sarasti, maybe.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Around me, the same magic worked at cooler temperatures and to less
volatile ends: a small riot of chutes and dispensers crowded the
bulkhead on all sides.  A few of those openings would choke on my
fist: one or two could swallow me whole.  <I>Theseus</I>' fabrication
plant could build everything from cutlery to cockpits.  Give it a big
enough matter stockpile and it could have even been built another
<I>Theseus</I>, albeit in many small pieces and over a very long
time.  Some wondered if it could build another crew as well, although
we'd all been assured that was impossible.  Not even these machines
had fine enough fingers to reconstruct a few trillion synapses in the
space of a human skull.  Not yet, anyway.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

if there'd been a cheaper alternative.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I faced forward.  Putting the back of my head against that sealed
hatch I could see almost to <I>Theseus</I>' bow,  an uninterrupted
line-of-sight extending to a tiny dark bull's-eye thirty meters
ahead.   It was like staring at a great textured target in shades of
white and gray:  concentric circles, hatches centered within
bulkheads one behind another, perfectly aligned.   Every one stood
open, in nonchalant defiance of a previous generation's safety codes.
 We could keep them closed if we wanted to, if it made us feel safer.
 That was all it would do, though;  it wouldn't improve our empirical
odds one whit.  In the event of trouble those hatches would slam shut
long milliseconds before Human senses could even make sense of an
alarm.  They weren't even computer-controlled.  <I>Theseus</I>' body
parts had <I>reflexes</I>.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I pushed off against the stern plating-wincing at the tug and
stretch of disused tendons-and coasted forward, leaving Fab
behind.   The shuttle-access hatches to <I>Scylla</I> and <I>Charybdis</I>
briefly constricted my passage to either side.  Past them the spine
widened into a corrugated extensible cylinder two meters across
and-at the moment-maybe fifteen long.  A pair of ladders
ran opposite each other along its length; raised portholes the size
of manhole covers stippled the bulkhead to either side.   Most of
those just looked into the hold.  A couple served as general-purpose
airlocks, should anyone want to take a stroll beneath the carapace.
One opened into my tent.  Another, four meters further forward,
opened into Bates'.

From a third, just short of the forward bulkhead, Jukka Sarasti
climbed into view like a long white spider.</P>

If he'd been Human I'd have known instantly what I saw there, I'd

his affect was so utterly without remorse.  The killing of a hundred

wax.</P>

As a child I'd read tales about jungle predators transfixing their
prey with a stare.  Only after I'd met Jukka Sarasti did I know how
it felt.  But he wasn't looking at me now.  He was focused on
installing his own tent, and even if he <I>had</I> looked me in the
eye there'd have been nothing to see but the dark wraparound visor he
wore in deference to Human skittishness.  He ignored me as I grabbed
a nearby rung and squeezed past.</P>

Into the drum (<I>drums</I>, technically; the BioMed hoop at the back
spun on its own bearings).  I flew through the center of a cylinder
sixteen meters across.  <I>Theseus</I>' spinal nerves ran along its
axis, the exposed plexii and piping bundled against the ladders on
either side.  Past them, Szpindel's and James' freshly-erected tents
rose from nooks on opposite sides of the world.  Szpindel himself
floated off my shoulder, still naked but for his gloves, and I could
tell from the way his fingers moved that his favorite color was
green.   He anchored himself to one of three stairways to nowhere
arrayed around the drum:  steep narrow steps rising five vertical
meters from the deck into empty air.</P>

The next hatch gaped dead-center of the drum's forward wall; pipes
and conduits plunged into the bulkhead to each side.  I grabbed a
convenient rung to slow myself-biting down once more on the
pain-and floated through.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
T-junction.  The spinal corridor continued forward, a smaller
diverticulum branched off to an EVA cubby and the forward airlock.  I
stayed the course and found myself back in the crypt, mirror-bright
and less than two meters deep.  Empty pods gaped to the left; sealed
ones huddled to the right.  We were so irreplaceable we'd come with
replacements.  They slept on, oblivious.  I'd met three of them back
in training.  Hopefully none of us would be getting reacquainted any
time soon.</P>

Another hatchway.  Smaller this time.  I squeezed through into the
bridge.  Dim light there, a silent shifting mosaic of icons and
alphanumerics iterating across dark glassy surfaces.  Not so much
bridge as cockpit, and a cramped one at that.  I'd emerged between
two acceleration couches, each surrounded by a horseshoe array of
controls and readouts.  Nobody expected to ever <I>use </I>this
compartment.  <I>Theseus</I> was perfectly capable of running
herself, and if she wasn't we were capable of running her from our
inlays, and if we weren't the odds were overwhelming that we were all
dead anyway.  Still, against that astronomically off-the-wall chance,
this was where one or two intrepid survivors could pilot the ship
home again after everything else had failed.</P>

dome like a pair of eyelids squeezed tight.  A single icon glowed
softly from a touchpad to my left; faint stray light followed me
through from the spine, brushed dim fingers across the concave
enclosure.  The dome resolved in faint shades of blue and gray as my
eyes adjusted.  A stale draft stirred the webbing floating from the
rear bulkhead, mixed oil and machinery at the back of my throat.

It had been scarcely two months since Helen had disappeared under the
cowl.  Two months by our reckoning, at least.   From her perspective
it could have been a day or a decade; the Virtually Omnipotent set
their subjective clocks along with everything else.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
She wasn't coming back.  She would only deign to see her husband
under conditions that amounted to a slap in the face.  He didn't
complain.  He visited as often as she would allow:  twice a week,
then once.  Then every two.  Their marriage decayed with the
exponential determinism of a radioactive isotope and still he sought
her out, and accepted her conditions.</P>

On the day the lights came down, I had joined him at my mother's
side.  It was a special occasion, the last time we would ever see her
in the flesh.  For two months her body had lain in state along with
five hundred other new ascendants on the ward, open for viewing by
the next of kin.  The interface was no more real than it would ever
be, of course; the body could not talk to us.  But at least it was
<I>there</I>, its flesh warm, the sheets clean and straight.  Helen's
lower face was still visible below the cowl, though eyes and ears
were helmeted.   We could touch her.  My father often did.  Perhaps
some distant part of her still felt it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
But eventually someone has to close the casket and dispose of the
remains.  Room must be made for the new arrivals-and so we came
to this last day at my mother's side.  Jim took her hand one more
time.  She would still be available in her world, on her terms, but
later this day the body would be packed into storage facilities
crowded far too efficiently for flesh and blood visitors.  We had
been assured that the body would remain intact-the muscles
electrically exercised, the body flexed and fed, the corpus kept
ready to return to active duty should Heaven experience some
inconceivable and catastrophic meltdown.  Everything was reversible,
we were told.  And yet-there were so many who had ascended, and
not even the deepest catacombs go on forever.  There were rumors of
dismemberment, of nonessential body parts hewn away over time
according to some optimum-packing algorithm.  Perhaps Helen would be
a torso this time next year, a disembodied head the year after.
Perhaps her chassis would be stripped down to the brain before we'd
even left the building, awaiting only that final technological
breakthrough that would herald the arrival of the Great Digital
Upload.</P>

after ascending, but then why would anyone want to?  Not even Lucifer

Dad might have known for sure-Dad knew more than most people,

never told tales out of turn.  Whatever he knew, he'd obviously

would have been enough for him.</P>

We donned the hoods that served as day passes for the Unwired, and we
met my mother in the spartan visiting room she imagined for these
visits.  She'd built no windows into the world she occupied, no hint
of whatever utopian environment she'd constructed for herself.   She
hadn't even opted for one of the prefab visiting environments
designed to minimize dissonance among visitors.  We found ourselves
in a featureless beige sphere five meters across.  There was nothing
in there but her.</P>

I would have given them a fucking lifetime.  I unplugged myself back
to the ward, looked from the corpse on the bed to my blind and
catatonic father in his couch, murmuring sweet nothings into the
datastream.   Let them perform for each other.  Let them formalize
and finalize their so-called relationship in whatever way they saw
fit.  Maybe, just once, they could even bring themselves to be
honest, there in that other world where everything else was a lie.

She had just stepped onto the street from the building across the
way.  She stood a head taller than the rest of us, her eyes shining
yellow and bright as a cat's in the deepening dark.  She realized, as
I watched, that something was amiss.  She looked around, glanced at

They clenched around the world like a fist, each black as the inside
of an event horizon until those last bright moments when they all
burned together.  They screamed as they died.  Every radio up to
geostat groaned in unison, every infrared telescope went briefly
snowblind.  Ashes stained the sky for weeks afterwards; mesospheric

after that, the first Fourier transforms appeared in the noosphere;
to no one's great surprise, the Fireflies had not wasted their dying
breaths on static.  There was pattern embedded in that terminal

heads.  I visited blathernodes, soaked myself in other people's

now we were all cavemen again, huddling beneath some overhang while
lightning split the heavens and vast formless monsters, barely

Yes, I know.  But imagine you're a different <I>kind</I> of machine,
one built from metal and plastic and designed not by blind, haphazard
natural selection but by engineers and astrophysicists with their
eyes fixed firmly on specific goals.  Imagine that your purpose is

I coast through the abyss on the colder side of Neptune's orbit.
Most of the time I exist only as an absence, to any observer on the
visible spectrum:  a moving, asymmetrical silhouette blocking the
stars.  But occasionally, during my slow endless spin, I glint with
dim hints of reflected starlight.  If you catch me in those moments
you might infer something of my true nature:  a segmented creature
with foil skin, bristling with joints and dishes and spindly
antennae.  Here and there a whisper of accumulated frost clings to a
joint or seam, some frozen wisp of gas encountered in Jupiter space
perhaps.  Elsewhere I carry the microscopic corpses of Earthly
bacteria who thrived with carefree abandon on the skins of space
stations or the benign lunar surface-but who had gone to
crystal at only half my present distance from the sun.  Now, a breath
away from Absolute Zero, they might shatter at a photon's touch.

My heart is warm, at least.  A tiny nuclear fire burns in my thorax,
leaves me indifferent to the cold outside.  It won't go out for a
thousand years, barring some catastrophic accident; for a thousand
years, I will listen for faint voices from Mission Control and do
everything they tell me to.   So far they have told me to study
comets.  Every instruction I have ever received has been a precise
and unambiguous elaboration on that one overriding reason for my
existence.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Which is why these latest instructions are so puzzling, for they make
no sense at all.  The frequency is wrong.  The signal strength is
wrong.  I cannot even understand the handshaking protocols.  I
request clarification.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The response arrives almost a thousand minutes later, and it is an
unprecedented mix of orders and requests for information.  I answer
as best I can:  yes, this is the bearing at which signal strength was
greatest.  No, it is not the usual bearing for Mission Control.  Yes,
I can retransmit:  here it is, all over again.  Yes, I will go into
standby mode.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I await further instructions.  They arrive 839 minutes later, and
they tell me to stop studying comets immediately.</P>

I am to commence a controlled precessive tumble that sweeps my
antennae through consecutive 5<FONT FACE="Symbol, serif">&#61616;</FONT>-arc
increments along all three axes, with a period of 94 seconds.  Upon
encountering any transmission resembling the one which confused me, I
am to fix upon the bearing of maximal signal strength and derive a
series of parameter values.  I am also instructed to retransmit the
signal to Mission Control.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I do as I'm told.  For a long time I hear nothing, but I am
infinitely patient and incapable of boredom.  Eventually a fleeting,
familiar signal brushes against my afferent array.  I reacquire and
track it to source, which I am well-equipped to describe:  a
trans-Neptunian comet in the Kuiper Belt, approximately two hundred
kilometers in diameter.  It is sweeping a 21-cm tightbeam radio wave
across the heavens with a periodicity of 4.57 seconds.  This beam
does not intersect Mission Control's coordinates at any point.  It
appears to be directed at a different target entirely.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
It takes much longer than usual for Mission Control to respond to
this information.  When it does, it tells me to change course.
Mission Control informs me that henceforth my new destination is to
be referred to as <I>Burns-Caulfield</I>.  Given current fuel and
inertial constraints I will not reach it in less than thirty-nine
years.</P>

I'd been liaising for a team at the Kurzweil Institute, a fractured
group of cutting-edge savants convinced they were on the verge of
solving the quantum-glial paradox.  That particular log-jam had
stalled AI for decades; once broken,  the experts promised we'd be
eighteen months away from the first personality upload and only two
years from reliable Human-consciousness emulation in a software
environment.  It would spell the end of corporeal history, usher in a
Singularity that had been waiting impatiently in the wings for nigh
on fifty years.</P>

Two months after Firefall, the Institute cancelled my contract.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I was actually surprised it had taken them so long.   It had cost us
so much, this overnight inversion of global priorities, these
breakneck measures making up for lost initiative.  Not even our shiny
new post-scarcity economy could withstand such a seismic shift
without lurching towards bankruptcy.   Installations in deep space,
long since imagined secure by virtue of their remoteness, were
suddenly vulnerable for exactly the same reason.  Lagrange habitats
had to be refitted for defense against an unknown enemy.  Commercial
ships on the Martian Loop were conscripted, weaponised, and
reassigned; some secured the high ground over Mars while others fell
sunward to guard the Icarus Array.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
It didn't matter that the Fireflies hadn't fired a shot at any of
these targets.  We simply couldn't afford the risk.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
We were all in it together, of course, desperate to regain some
hypothetical upper hand by any means necessary.  Kings and
corporations scribbled IOUs on the backs of napkins and promised to
sort everything out once the heat was off.  In the meantime, the
prospect of Utopia in two years took a back seat to the shadow of
Armageddon reaching back from next Tuesday.  The Kurzweil Institute,
like everyone else, suddenly had other things to worry about.</P>

So I returned to my apartment, split a bulb of Glenfiddich, and
arrayed virtual windows like daisy petals in my head.  Everyone Icons
debated on all sides, serving up leftovers two weeks past their
expiry date:

It was a rhetorical request.  His silence was hardly necessary to
make the point.  &quot;I know,&quot; I added after a moment.  &quot;Sorry.

We'd never gone to the Kuiper before.  It had been decades since we'd
even sent robots.  Not that we lacked the capacity.  We just hadn't
bothered; everything we needed was so much closer to home.  The
Interplanetary Age had stagnated at the asteroids.</P>

He gave me a few extra seconds to digest that.  When I still didn't
speak, he said,  &quot;You have to understand.  Our only edge is that
as far as we know, Burns-Caulfield doesn't know we're on to it.  We

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

He didn't have to answer.  I didn't have to ask.  At these kind of
stakes, mission-critical elements didn't get the luxury of choice.  I
wouldn't even have the childish satisfaction of holding my breath and
refusing to play-the will to resist is no less mechanical than
the urge to breathe. Both can be subverted with the right

I am not an entirely new breed.  My roots reach back to the dawn of
civilization but those precursors served a different function, a less
honorable one.  They only greased the wheels of social stability;
they would sugarcoat unpleasant truths, or inflate imaginary bogeymen
for political expedience.  They were vital enough in their way.  Not
even the most heavily-armed police state can exert brute force on all
of its citizens all of the time.  Meme management is so much subtler;
 the rose-tinted refraction of perceived reality, the contagious fear
of threatening alternatives.  There have always been those tasked

The new Millennium changed all that.  We've surpassed ourselves now,
we're exploring terrain beyond the limits of merely human
understanding.   Sometimes its contours, even in conventional space,
are just too intricate for our brains to track; other times its very
axes extend into dimensions inconceivable to minds built to fuck and
fight on some prehistoric grassland.  So many things constrain us,
from so many directions.  The most altruistic and sustainable
philosophies fail before the brute brain-stem imperative of
self-interest.  Subtle and elegant equations <I>predict</I> the
behavior of the quantum world, but none can <I>explain</I> it.  After
four thousand years we can't even prove that reality exists beyond
the mind of the first-person dreamer. We have such need of intellects
greater than our own.</P>

But we're not very good at building them.  The forced matings of
minds and electrons succeed and fail with equal spectacle.  Our
hybrids become as brilliant as savants, and as autistic.  We graft
people to prosthetics, make their overloaded motor strips juggle meat
and machinery, and shake our heads when their fingers twitch and
their tongues stutter.  Computers bootstrap their own offspring, grow
so wise and incomprehensible that their communiqu-s assume the
hallmarks of dementia:  unfocused and irrelevant to the
barely-intelligent creatures  left behind.</P>

<I>Burns-Caufield sings as we glide past.  Not to us; it ignores our
passage as it ignored our approach.  It sings to someone else
entirely.  Perhaps we'll meet that audience some day.  Perhaps
they're waiting in the desolate wastelands ahead of us.  Mission
Control flips us onto our backs, keeps us fixed on target past any
realistic hope of acquisition.  They send last-ditch instructions,
squeeze our fading signals for every last bit among the static.  I

string.  Our autonomous microprobes measure everything our masters
anticipated; tiny onboard assembly lines can build tools from the

the Commons,  keeping a discreet and constant distance from the
curved deck beneath.  The whole drum was furnished in Early Concave,

at the world through fisheye lenses.  In deference to the creakiness
of the<I> nouveaux undead</I> it spun at a mere fifth of a gee, but

On the display it was-nothing.  Our apparent destination was a
black disk, a round absence of stars.  In real life it weighed in at
over ten Jupiters and measured twenty percent wider at the belly.  It
was directly in our path:  too small to burn, too remote for the
reflection of distant sunlight, too heavy for a gas giant, too light
for a brown dwarf.

&quot;X-ray spike appears during the '76 microwave survey.&quot;  Six
years before Firefall.  &quot;Never confirmed, never reacquired.

gets-<I>crowded</I>, after Firefall.  Everyone <I>skittish</I>,
looking for clues.  After Burns-Caulfield explodes-&quot;  He
clicked at the back of his throat.  &quot;Turns out the spike might

torqued enough.&quot;</P>

Layers of statistical inference piled up on the table while Sarasti
sketched background:  even with a solid bearing and half the world's
attention, the object had hidden from all but the most intensive
search.  A thousand telescopic snapshots had been stacked one on
another and squeezed through a dozen filters before something emerged
from the static, just below the three-meter band and the threshold of
certainty.  For the longest time it hadn't even been real:  just a
probabilistic ghost until <I>Theseus</I> got close enough to collapse
the waveform.  A quantum particle, heavy as ten Jupiters.

long dejected loop back home.  But <I>Theseus</I>' thin, infinitely

Across the table, Bates flicked her wrist.  Her ball sailed over my
head; I heard it bounce off the deck (<I>not the deck</I>, something
in me amended: <I>handrail</I>).   &quot;We're assuming the comet was
a deliberate decoy, then.&quot;</P>

Sarasti nodded.  The ball riccocheted back into my line of sight high
overhead and disappeared briefly behind the spinal bundle, looping
through some eccentric, counterintuitive parabola in the drum's
feeble grav.

The ball bounced one last time and wobbled back towards the Commons.
Bates half-hopped from her seat (she floated briefly), barely
catching it on its way past.  There remained a new-born-animal
awkwardness to her movements, half Coriolis, half residual rigor.
Still:  a big improvement in four hours.  The rest of the Humans were

Bates kneaded the recovered ball with her fingertips.  &quot;The
second mouse gets the cheese.  We may have blown our top-of-the-line
recon in the Kuiper, but we don't have to go in blind.  Send in our
own drones along separate vectors.  Hold off on a close approach

hostiles.&quot;</P>

James shook her head.  &quot;If they were hostile, they could have

Sarasti continued.  &quot;They trade stealth for speed.  By the time

patiently, a well-fed predator explaining the rules of the game to
prey that really should know better:  <I>the longer it takes me to

But Sascha had already fled.  Her surfaces had scattered like a flock

it was Susan James who spoke through it.  &quot;Sascha's aware of the

&quot;Probably no big deal.  I'm sure they'll still be willing to

little more cautious, perhaps...&quot;</P>

Bates frowned and pitched her ball back into orbit.  &quot;Sir, all

technical specs in his head he never really <I>got</I> it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He called me, before we left.  I hadn't been expecting it; ever since
the roster had been announced our watches had blocked calls from
anyone not explicitly contact-listed.  I'd forgotten that Pag had
been.  We hadn't spoken since Chelsea.  I'd given up on ever hearing
from him again.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
But there he was.  &quot;Pod-man.&quot;  He smiled, a tentative
overture.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;It's good to see you,&quot; I said, because that's what people
said in similar situations.

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Yeah, well I saw your name in the noose.  You've made it big,
for a baseline.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Not so big.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Crap.  You're the vanguard of the Human Race.  You're our
first, last, and only hope against the unknown.  Man, you <I>showed</I>
them.&quot;  He held his fist up and shook it, vicariously
triumphant.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<I>Showing them</I> had become a cornerstone of Robert Paglino's
life.  He'd really made it work for him, too, overcome the handicap
of a natural birth with retrofits and enhancements and sheer
bloody-mindedness.  In a world in which Humanity had become redundant
in unprecedented numbers, we'd both retained the status of another
age:  <I>working professional</I>.</P>

&quot;So you're taking orders from a vamp,&quot; he said now.  &quot;Talk
about fighting fire with fire.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I guess it's practice.  Until we run up against the real
thing.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He laughed.  I couldn't imagine why.  But I smiled back anyway.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
It <I>was</I> good to see him.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;So, what are they like?&quot; Pag asked.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Vampires?  I don't know.  Just met my first one yesterday.&quot;</P>

&quot;And?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Hard to read.  Didn't even seem to be aware of his surroundings

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;He's aware all right.  Those things are so fast it's scary.
You know they can hold both aspects of a Necker cube in their heads
at the same time?&quot;</P>

&quot;You or I, we can only see it one way or the other,&quot; Pag

&quot;It was at first.  How many intersecting right angles do you see
in nature?&quot;  He waved one dismissive hand.  &quot;Anyway, that's
not the point.  The point is they can do something that's
neurologically impossible for us Humans.  They can hold <I>simultaneous
multiple worldviews</I>, Pod-man.  They just <I>see</I> things we
have to work out step-by-step, they don't have to <I>think</I> about
it.  You know, there isn't a single baseline human who could just

&quot;Huh?  Oh, that.&quot;  Pag nodded.  &quot;They never <I>experience</I>

Pag blamed me for the way it had ended with Chelsea.  Fair enough.  I
blamed him for the way it began.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He'd gone into neuroeconomics at least partly because his childhood
buddy had turned into a pod person before his eyes.  I'd ended up in
Synthesis for roughly the same reason.  Our paths had diverged, and
we didn't see each other in the flesh all that often; but two decades
after I'd brutalized a handful of children on his behalf, Robert
Paglino was still my best and only friend.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;You need to seriously thaw out,&quot; he told me, &quot;And I

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;That is perhaps the worst use of metaphor in the history of

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

&quot;No, Pag, I don't.  What is she, another neuroeconomist?&quot;</P>

&quot;Neuroaestheticist,&quot; he said.</P>

&quot;There's still a market for those?&quot;  I couldn't imagine
how; why pay to tweak your compatibility with some significant other,
when significant others themselves were so out of fashion?</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Not much of one,&quot; Pag admitted.  &quot;Fact is, she's
pretty much retired.  But she's still got the tools, my man. Very
thigmotactic.  Likes all her relationships face-to-face and in the
flesh.&quot;</P>

&quot;Not like <I>your</I> work.  She's got to be easier than the
bleeding composites you front for.  She's smart, she's sexy, and
she's nicely inside the standard deev except for the personal contact
thing.  Which is not so much outright perversion as charming fetish.
In your case it could even be therapeutic.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

He looked me up and down.  &quot;No one's <I>that</I> good.  That's

Which was how I found myself intrusively face-to-face in an airspace
lounge south of Beth and Bear.  The lighting was low and indirect,
creeping from under seats and the edges of tables; the chromatics,
this afternoon at least, were defiantly longwave.  It was a place
where baselines could pretend to see in infrared.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
So I pretended for a moment, assessing the woman in the corner booth:
 gangly and glorious, half-a-dozen ethnicities coexisting peacefully
with no single voice dominant.  Something glowed on her cheek, a
faint emerald staccato against the ambient red shift. Her hair
floated in a diffuse ebony cloud about her head;  as I neared I
caught occasional glints of metal within that nimbus, the threads of
a static generator purveying the illusion of weightlessness.  In
normal light her blood-red skin would doubtless shift down to the
fashionable butterscotch of the unrepentant mongrel.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
She <I>was</I> attractive, but so was everyone in this kind of light;
the longer the wavelength, the softer the focus.  There's a reason
fuckcubbies don't come with fluorescent lights.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<I>You will not fall for this</I>, I told myself.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Chelsea,&quot; she said.  Her little finger rested on one of
the table's inset trickle-chargers.   &quot;Former neuroaestheticist,

She waved at the empty seat.  I took it, assessing the system before
me, sizing up the best approach for a fast yet diplomatic disconnect.
 The set of her shoulders told me she enjoyed lightscapes, and was
embarrassed to admit it.  Monahan was her favorite artist.  She
thought herself a natural girl because she'd stayed on chemical
libidinals all these years, even though a synaptic edit would have
been simpler.  She revelled in her own inconsistency: a woman whose
professional machinery edited thought itself, yet mistrustful of the
dehumanising impact of telephones.  Innately affectionate, and
innately afraid of unreturned affection, and indomitably unwilling to
let any of that stop her.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

Chelsea gestured at my side of the table.  The touchpads there glowed
soft, dissonant sapphire in the bloody light, like a set of splayed

something.&quot;</P>

Assembly-line neuropharm doesn't do much for me; it's optimized for

them.&quot;</P>

how do you comprehend them?&quot;</P>

Chelsea grimaced; the butterfly on her cheek fluttered nervously at
the motion, wings brightening.  &quot;God, you make it sound like we
turn them into zombies or something.  They're just tweaks, mainly.
Changing taste in music or cuisine, you know, optimizing mate

&quot;Nah.  Too much developmental variation between brains; our
targeting is <I>really</I> fine-scale.  But it's not all microsurgery
and fried synapses, you know.   You'd be surprised how much rewiring
can be done noninvasively.  You can start all sorts of cascades just
by playing certain sounds in the right order, or showing images with
the right balance of geometry and emotion.&quot;</P>

&quot;Not really.  Rhythm and music hang their hats on the same basic

just a tyke.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

I felt something then, a strange, unfamiliar sensation that somehow
loosened my vertebrae.  The chair felt subtly, indefinably more
comfortable at my back.

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Anyway.&quot;  My silence had thrown her off-stride.  &quot;Haven't
done it much since the bottom dropped out of the market.  But it <I>did</I>
leave me with a fondness for face-to-face encounters, if you know
what I mean.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Yeah.  Pag said you took your sex in the first-person.&quot;</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I wasn't certain.  I was a virgin in the real world, one of the few
things I still had in common with the rest of civilized society.  &quot;In
principle, I guess.  It just seems-a lot of effort for not as
much payoff, you know?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Don't I.&quot;  She smiled.  &quot;Real fuckbuddies aren't
airbrushed.  Got all these <I>needs</I> and <I>demands</I> that you
can't edit out.  How can you blame anyone for saying <I>no thanks</I>
to all that, now there's a choice?  You gotta wonder how our parents
ever stayed together sometimes.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<I>You gotta wonder </I>why<I> they did</I>.  I felt myself sinking
deeper into the chair, wondered again at this strange new sensation.
Chelsea had said the dopamine was tweaked.  That was probably it.</P>

She leaned forward, not coy, not coquettish, not breaking eye contact
for an instant in the longwave gloom.  I could smell the lemony tang
of  pheromones and synthetics mingling on her skin.  &quot;But there
are advantages too, once you learn the moves,&quot; she said.  &quot;The
body's got a long memory. And you <I>do</I> realize that there's no
trickler under your left finger there, don't you, Siri?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I looked.  My left arm was slightly extended, index finger touching
one of the trickle pads; and my right had mirrored the motion while I
wasn't watching, its own finger tapping uselessly on blank tabletop.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I pulled it back.  &quot;Bit of a bilateral twitch,&quot; I admitted.
 &quot;The body creeps into symmetrical poses when I'm not looking.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I waited for a joke, or at least a raised eyebrow.  Chelsea just
nodded and resumed her thread.  &quot;So if you're game for this, so
am I.  I've never been entangled with a synthesist before.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Don't you just always know just exactly what to say.&quot;  She
cocked her head at me.  &quot;So, your name.  What's it mean?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

&quot;Well, it's not good enough.  If we're gonna to be swapping spit

something.&quot;</P>

And we were, I realized.  Chelsea had decided while I wasn't looking.
 I could have stopped her right there, told her what a bad idea this
was, apologized for any misunderstanding.  But then there'd be
wounded looks and hurt feelings and guilt because after all, if I
wasn't interested why the hell had I even shown up?</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

<I>Just for a while</I>, I told myself.  <I>It'll be an experience</I>.</P>

I furrowed my brow at her, but I knew exactly what she meant:  a
dark, dense object that sucks up the light and destroys everything in
its path.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Thanks a whole fucking lot.  Why?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I'm not sure.  Something dark about you.&quot;  She shrugged,
and gave me a great toothy grin.  &quot;But it's not unattractive.
And let me give you a tweak or two, I bet you'd grow right out of
it.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

Our scout fell towards orbit, watching Ben.  We fell days behind,
watching the scout.  And that was <I>all</I> we did:  sit in <I>Theseus</I>'
belly while the system streamed telemetry to our inlays.  Essential,
irreplaceable, mission-critical-we might as well have been
ballast during that first approach.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
We passed Ben's Rayleigh limit.  <I>Theseus</I> squinted at a meager
emission spectrum and saw a rogue halo element from Canis Major-a
dismembered remnant of some long-lost galaxy that had drifted into
ours and ended up as road kill, uncounted billions of years ago.  We
were closing on something from outside the Milky Way.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The probe arced down and in, drew close enough for false-color
enhance.  Ben's surface brightened to a seething parfait of
high-contrast bands against a diamond-hard starscape.  Something
twinkled there, faint sparkles on endless overcast.

Morphometrics scrolled across my inlays:  mass,  diameter,  mean
density.  Ben's day lasted seven hours twelve minutes.  Diffuse but
massive accretion belt circling the equator, more torus than ring,
extending almost a half-million kilometers from the cloud-tops: the
pulverized corpses of moons perhaps, ground down to leftovers.

He seemed to be right; increasing proximity smeared many of those
pinpoint sparkles into bright ephemeral hyphens, scratching the
atmosphere.  Closer to the poles, cloud bands flickered with dim,
intermittent flashes of electricity.</P>

Weak radio emission peaks at 31 and 400m. Outer atmosphere heavy with
methane and ammonia; lithium, water, carbon monoxide in abundance.
Ammonia hydrogen sulfide, alkali halide mixing locally in those torn
swirling clouds.  Neutral alkalis in the upper layers.  By now even
<I>Theseus</I> could pick those things out from a distance, but our
scout was close enough to see filigree.  It no longer saw a disk.  It
gazed down at a dark convex wall in seething layers of red and brown,
saw faint stains of anthracene and pyrene.</P>

One of a myriad meteorite contrails scorched Ben's face directly
ahead; for a moment I thought I could even see the tiny dark speck at
its core, but sudden static scratched the feed.    Bates cursed
softly.  The image blurred, then steadied as the probe pitched its
voice higher up the spectrum.  Unable to make itself heard above the
longwave din, now it spoke down a laser.</P>

And still it stuttered.  Keeping it aligned across a million
fluctuating kilometers should have posed no problem
at all; our respective trajectories were known parabolas, our
relative positions infinitely predictable at any time <I>t</I>.  But
the meteorite's contrail jumped and skittered on the feed, as if the
beam were being repeatedly, infinitesimally knocked out of alignment.
 Incandescent gas blurred its details; I doubted that even a
rock-steady image would have offered any sharp edges for a human eye
to hold on to.  Still.  There was something <I>wrong</I> about it

Sarasti clicked from the back of his throat and the back of the ship.
 A moment later he served up an instant replay, those last few
seconds of telemetry zoomed and smoothed and contrast-enhanced from
visible light down to deep infrared.  There was that same dark shard
cauled in flame, there was the contrail burning in its wake.  Now it
dimmed as the object skipped off the denser atmosphere beneath and
regained altitude.  Within moments the heat trace had faded entirely.
 The thing that had burned at its center rose back into space, a
fading ember.  A great conic scoop at its front end gaped like a
mouth.  Stubby fins disfigured an ovoid abdomen.</P>

<I>Theseus</I> weaned herself with a ninety-eight-second burn, edged
us into some vast arc that might, with a little effort, turn into an
orbit-or into a quick discreet flyby if the neighborhood turned
out to be a little too rough.  The Icarus stream fell invisibly to
port, its unswerving energy lost to space-time.  Our city-sized,
molecule-thick parasol wound down and packed itself away until the
next time the ship got thirsty.  Antimatter stockpiles began dropping
immediately; this time we were alive to watch it happen.  The dip was
infinitesimal, but there was something disquieting about the sudden
appearance of that minus sign on the display.</P>

We could have retained the apron strings, left a buoy behind in the

We sent more probes ahead, though, spat them out hard and fast and
too fuel-constrained for anything but flyby and self-destruct.  They
couldn't take their eyes off the machines swinging around Big Ben.
<I>Theseus</I> stared her own unblinking stare, more distant though
more acute.  But if those high divers even knew we were out there,
they ignored us completely.  We tracked them across the closing
distance, watched them swoop and loop though a million parabolas at a
million angles.  We never saw them collide-not with each other,
not with the cauldron of rock tumbling around Ben's equator.  Every
perigee dipped briefly into atmosphere; there they burned, and
slowed, and accelerated back into space, their anterior scoops
glowing with residual heat.

We tracked nearly four hundred thousand in less than two days.  That
appeared to be most of them; new sightings leveled off afterwards,
the cumulative curve flattening towards some theoretical asymptote.
Most of the orbits were close and fast, but Sarasti projected a
frequency distribution extending almost back to Pluto.  We might stay
out here for years, and still catch the occasional new shovelnose
returning from its extended foray into the void.

One night-as such things were measured on board- I
followed a soft squeal of tortured electronics up to the observation
blister.  Szpindel floated there, watching the skimmers.  He'd closed
the clamshells, blocked off the stars and built a little analytical
nest in their place.  Graphs and windows spilled across the inside of

insufficient to contain them.  Tactical graphics lit him from all

Bates was right, by the way.  <I>Theseus</I> was officially tricked
out for exploration, not combat.  No doubt our masters would have
preferred to load her up with nukes and particle cannons as well as
her scientific payload, but not even a telemattered fuel stream can
change the laws of inertia.  A weaponized prototype would have taken
longer to build; a more massive one, laden with heavy artillery,
would take longer to accelerate.  Time, our masters had decided, was
of greater essence than armament.  In a pinch our fabrication
facilities could build most anything we needed, given time.  It might
take a while to build a particle-beam cannon from scratch, and we
might have to scavenge a local asteroid for the raw material, but we
could do it.  Assuming our enemies would be willing to wait, in the
interests of fair play.

But what were the odds that even our best weapons would prove
effective against the intelligence that had pulled off the Firefall?
If the unknown was hostile, we were probably doomed no matter what we
did.  The Unknown <I>was</I> technologically advanced-and there
were some who claimed that that made them hostile by definition.
<I>Technology Implies Belligerence</I>, they said.

Once there were three tribes.   The Optimists, whose patron saints
were Drake and Sagan, believed in a universe crawling with gentle
intelligence-spiritual brethren vaster and more enlightened
than we, a great galactic siblinghood into whose ranks we would
someday ascend.  <I>Surely, </I>said the Optimists, <I> space travel
implies enlightenment, for it requires the control of great
destructive energies.  Any race which can't rise above its own brutal
instincts will wipe itself out long before it learns to bridge the
interstellar gulf.</I>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Across from the Optimists sat the Pessimists, who genuflected before
graven images of Saint Fermi and a host of lesser lightweights.  The
Pessimists envisioned a lonely universe full of dead rocks and
prokaryotic slime.  <I>The odds are just too low</I>, they insisted.
<I>Too many rogues, too much radiation, too much eccentricity in too
many orbits.  It is a surpassing miracle that even </I>one<I> Earth
exists; to hope for </I>many<I> is to abandon reason and embrace

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Equidistant to the other two tribes sat the Historians.  They didn't
have too many thoughts on the probable prevalence of intelligent,

It might seem almost too obvious a conclusion.  What is Human
history, if not an ongoing succession of greater technologies
grinding lesser ones beneath their boots?  But the subject wasn't
merely <I>Human</I> history, or the unfair advantage that tools gave
to any given side; the oppressed snatch up advanced weaponry as
readily as the oppressor, given half a chance.  No, the real issue
was how those tools got there in the first place.  The real issue was
what tools are <I>for</I>.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
To the Historians, tools existed for only one reason:  to force the
universe into unnatural shapes.  They treated nature as an enemy,
they were by definition a rebellion against the way things were.
Technology is a stunted thing in benign environments, it never
thrived in any culture gripped by belief in natural harmony.  Why
invent fusion reactors if your climate is comfortable, if your food
is abundant?  Why build fortresses if you have no enemies?  Why force
change upon a world which poses no threat?</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Human civilization had a lot of branches, not so long ago.  Even into
the twenty-first century, a few isolated tribes had barely developed
stone tools.  Some settled down with agriculture.  Others weren't
content until they had ended nature itself, still others until they'd
built cities in space.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
We all rested eventually, though.  Each new technology trampled

for existence.  There could be other, more hellish worlds where the
best Human technology would crumble, where the environment was still
the enemy, where the only survivors were those who fought back with
sharper tools and stronger empires.  The threats contained in those
environments would not be simple ones.  Harsh weather and natural
disasters either kill you or they don't, and once conquered-or
adapted to- they lose their relevance.  No, the only
environmental factors that continued to matter were those that fought
back, that countered new strategies with newer ones, that forced
their enemies to scale ever-greater heights just to stay alive.
Ultimately, the only enemy that mattered was an <I>intelligent</I>
one.</P>

The argument was straightforward enough.  It might even have been
enough to carry the Historians to victory-if such debates were
ever settled on the basic of logic, and if a bored population hadn't
already awarded the game to Fermi on points.  But the Historian
paradigm was just too ugly, too <I>Darwinian</I>, for most people,
and besides, no one really cared any more.  Not even the Cassidy
Survey's late-breaking discoveries changed much.  So what if some
dirtball at Ursae Majoris Eridani had an oxygen atmosphere?  It was
forty-three lightyears away, and it wasn't talking; and if you wanted
flying chandeliers and alien messiahs, you could build them to order
in Heaven.  If you wanted testosterone and target practice you could
choose an afterlife chock-full of nasty alien monsters with really
bad aim.  If the mere thought of an alien intelligence threatened
your worldview, you could explore a virtual galaxy of empty real
estate, ripe and waiting for any God-fearing earthly pilgrims who
chanced by.</P>

Residents are fish-eaters, eh?  They hang out in big groups, don't
move around much, talk all the time.&quot;  I heard a whisper of
motion, imagined Szpindel leaning in and laying a hand on Michelle's
arm.  I imagined the sensors in his gloves telling him what she felt
like.  &quot;Transients, now-they eat <I>mammals</I>.  Seals,
sea lions, <I>smart</I> prey.  Smart enough to take cover when they
hear a fluke slap or a click train.  So transients are <I>sneaky</I>,
eh?  Hunt in small groups, range all over the place, keep their

&quot;Man's instincts tell him to keep quiet around prey.  Every time
he opens his mouth, every time he lets us <I>see</I> him, he's
fighting his own brain stem.  Maybe we shouldn't be too harsh on the

eh?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

 That's reassuring.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Szpindel chuckled.  &quot;It's probably not that bad.  I guess even
killer whales let their guard down after making a kill.  Why sneak
around on a full stomach, eh?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

hungry.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Probably a little of both.  Brain stem never really <I>goes
away</I>, you know.  But I'll tell you one thing.&quot; Some of the
playfulness ebbed from Szpindel's voice.  &quot;I've got no problem
if Sarasti wants to run the occasional briefing from his quarters.
But the moment we stop seeing him altogether?  That's when you start
watching your back.&quot;

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I had my own style, of course.  I tried to be charming in my own
peculiar way.  Once, after one too many fights about <I>honesty </I>and
<I>emotional manipulation</I>, I'd started to think maybe a touch of
whimsy might smooth things over.  I had come to suspect that Chelsea
just didn't understand sexual politics.  Sure she'd edited brains for
a living, but maybe she'd just memorized all that circuitry without
giving any thought to how it had arisen in the first place, to the
ultimate rules of natural selection that had shaped it.  Maybe she
honestly didn't know that we were evolutionary enemies, that <I>all</I>
relationships were doomed to failure.  If I could slip that insight
into her head- if I could <I>charm</I> my way past her
defenses- maybe we'd be able to hold things together.</P>

There were stories, before we left Earth, of a fourth wave:  a fleet
of deep-space dreadnoughts running silent in our wake, should the
cannon fodder up front run into something nasty.  Or, if the aliens
were friendly, an ambassadorial frigate full of politicians and CEOs
ready to elbow their way to the front of the line.  Never mind that
Earth had no deep-space dreadnoughts or ambassadorial spaceships;
<I>Theseus</I> hadn't existed either, before Firefall.  Nobody had

Ben's accretion belt still wasn't behaving.  Its delinquency wasn't
obvious; Sarasti hadn't had to plot every pebble and mountain and
planetesimal to find the pattern, but he'd come close.  And neither
he nor the conjoined intelligence he shared with the Captain had been
able to explain those trajectories as the mere aftermath of some past
disturbance.  The dust wasn't just <I>settling</I>; some of it
marched downhill to the beat of something that even now reached out
from the cloud-tops and pulled debris from orbit.</P>

Not all that debris seemed to hit.  Ben's equatorial regions
flickered constantly with the light of meteorite impacts-much
fainter than the bright wakes of the skimmers, and gone in the wink
of an eye-but those frequency distributions didn't quite
account for all the rocks that had fallen.  It was almost as though,
every now and then, some piece of incoming detritus simply vanished
into a parallel universe.</P>

Or got caught by something in <I>this</I> one.  Something that
circled Ben's equator every forty hours, almost low enough to graze
the atmosphere.  Something that didn't show up in visible light, or

Sarasti threw that one dead center: a bright contrail streaking
diagonally across Ben's perpetual nightscape, stuttering partway a

It was all there on tactical:  <I>Theseus</I> fell inwards along an
obvious arc, but the probes we'd dispatched hadn't dicked around with
Hohmann transfers:  they'd burned straight down, their courses barely
bending, all within a few degrees of the theoretical line connecting
Ben to <I>Theseus</I>.</P>

&quot;The further from our bearing, the more obvious the
discontinuity,&quot; Sarasti intoned.  &quot;Think it's clearly
visible on any approach perpendicular to ours.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The freeze-frame's pixels began to <I>crawl</I>.  Something emerged,
granular and indistinct, from the turbulent swirls and curlicues of
Ben's atmosphere.  There were curves, and spikes, and no smooth
edges; I couldn't tell how much of the shape was real, and how much a
fractal intrusion of underlying cloudscape. But the overall outline
was that of a torus, or perhaps a collection of smaller jagged things
piled together in a rough ring; and it was <I>big</I>.  Those nine
klicks of displaced contrail had merely grazed the perimeter, cut
across an arc of forty or fifty degrees.  This thing hiding in the
shadow of ten Jupiters was almost thirty kilometers from side to
side.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Sometime during Sarasti's executive summary we'd stopped
accellerating.  <I>Down</I> was back where it belonged.  We weren't,
though.  Our hesitant maybe-maybe-not approach was a thing of the
past:  we vectored straight in now, and damn the torpedoes.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Er, that's thirty klicks across,&quot; Sascha pointed out.
&quot;And it's <I>invisible</I>.  Shouldn't we maybe be a little <I>more</I>
cautious now?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

They all performed what duties they could.  Szpindel ran Sarasti's
sketchy silhouette through a series of filters, perchance to squeeze
a bit of biology from engineering.  Bates compared morphometrics
between the cloaked artefact and the skimmers.  Sarasti watched us
all from overhead and thought vampire thoughts deeper than anything
we could aspire to.  But it was all just make-work.  The Gang of Four
was on center stage, under the capable direction of Susan James.</P>

uninterrupted nonstop communication made vastly easier than anyone
had expected.  It spoke our language, after all.  Repeatedly it
expressed polite concern for our welfare.  And yet, for all its

regard their own platform the way we'd regard a ship, and picked one
of our names to fit.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Szpindel dropped into the chair beside me, fresh from a galley run.
A bulb of coffee glistened like gelatin in his hand.  &quot;<I>That</I>
name, out of all the ships in the innersys?  Seems way too symbolic
for a random choice.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I don't think it was random.  Unusual ship names provoke
comment;  <I>Rorschach</I>'s pilot goes ship-to-ship with some other
vessel, the other vessel comes back with <I>oh Grandma, what an
unusual name you have</I>, <I>Rorschach</I> replies with some
off-the-cuff comment about nomenclatural origins and it all goes out
in the EM.  Someone listening to all that chatter not only figures
out the name and the thing it applies to, but can get some sense of
meaning from the context.  Our alien friends probably eavesdropped on
half the registry and deduced that <I>Rorschach</I> would be a better
tag for something unfamiliar than, say, the<I> SS Jaymie Matthews</I>.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Territorial <I>and</I> smart.&quot;  Szpindel grimaced,
conjuring a mug from beneath his chair.  &quot;Wonderful.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Bates shrugged.  &quot;Territorial, maybe.  Not necessarily
aggressive.  In fact, I wonder if they could hurt us even if they
wanted to.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I don't,&quot; Szpindel said. &quot;Those skimmers-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The major waved a dismissive hand. &quot;Big ships turn slowly.  If
they were setting up to snooker us we'd see it well in advance.&quot;
 She looked around the table.  &quot;Look, am I the only one who
finds this odd?  An interstellar technology that redecorates
superJovians and lines up meteoroids like elephants on parade, and
they were <I>hiding</I>?  From <I>us</I>?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Unless there's someone else out here,&quot; James suggested
uneasily.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Bates shook her head.  &quot;The cloak was directional.  It was aimed
at us and no one else.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;And even we saw through it,&quot;  Szpindel added.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Exactly.  So they go to Plan B, which so far amounts to nothing
but bluster and vague warnings.  I'm just saying, they're not <I>acting</I>
like giants.  <I>Rorschach</I>'s behavior feels-improvised.  I
don't think they expected us.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;'Course not.  Burns-Caulfield was-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I don't think they expected us <I>yet</I>.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Um,&quot; Szpindel said, digesting it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The major ran one hand over her naked scalp.  &quot;Why would they
expect us to just <I>give up</I> after we learned we'd been sniped?
Of course we'd look elsewhere.  Burns-Caulfield could only have been
intended as a delaying action; if I was them, I'd plan on us getting
out here eventually.  But I think they miscalculated somehow.  We got
out here sooner than they expected and caught them with their pants
down.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Szpindel split the bulb and emptied it into his mug.  &quot;Pretty
large miscalculation for something so smart, eh?&quot;  A hologram
bloomed on contact with the steaming liquid, glowing in soft
commemoration of the Gaza Glasslands.  The scent of plasticised
coffee flooded the Commons.  &quot;Especially after they'd surveilled
us down to the square meter,&quot; he added.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;And what did they see?  I-CANNs.  Solar sails. Ships that  take
years to reach the Kuiper, and don't have the reserves to go anywhere
else afterwards.  Telematter didn't exist beyond Boeing's simulators
and a half-dozen protypes back then.  Easy to miss.  They must've
figured one decoy would buy them all the time they needed.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;To do what?&quot; James wondered.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Whatever it is,&quot; Bates said, &quot;We're ringside.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Szpindel raised his mug with an infirm hand and sipped.  The coffee
trembled in its prison, the surface wobbling and blobbing in the
drum's half-hearted gravity.  James pursed her lips in faint
disapproval.  Open-topped containers for liquids were technically
<I>verboten</I> in variable-gravity environments, even for people
without Szpindel's dexterity issues.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;So they're bluffing,&quot; Szpindel said at last.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Bates nodded.  &quot;That's my guess.  <I>Rorschach</I>'s still under
construction.  We could be dealing with an automated system of some
kind.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;So we can ignore the keep-off-the-grass signs, eh?  Walk right
in.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;We can afford to bide our time.  We can afford to not push it.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Ah.  So even though we could maybe handle it now, you want to
wait until it graduates from <I>covert</I> to <I>invulnerable</I>.&quot;
 Szpindel shuddered, set down his coffee.  &quot;Where'd you get your
military training again?  Sporting Chance Academy?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Bates ignored the jibe.  &quot;The fact that <I>Rorschach</I>'s still
growing may be the best reason to leave it alone for a while.  We
don't have any idea what the-mature, I guess-what the
mature form of this artefact might be.  Sure, it hid.  Lots of
animals take cover from predators without <I>being</I> predators,
especially young ones.  Sure, it's-evasive.  Doesn't give us
the answers we want.  But maybe it doesn't <I>know</I> them, did you
consider that?  How much luck would you have interrogating a Human
embryo?   Adult could be a whole different animal.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Adult could put our asses through a meatgrinder.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;So could the <I>embryo</I> for all we know.&quot;  Bates rolled
her eyes.  &quot;Jesus, Isaac, <I>you're</I> the biologist.  I
shouldn't have to tell you how many shy reclusive critters pack a
punch when they're cornered.  Porcupine doesn't want any trouble, but
he'll still give you a faceful of quills if you ignore the warning.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Szpindel said nothing.  He slid his coffee sideways along the concave
tabletop, to the very limit of his reach.  The liquid sat there in
its mug, a dark circle perfectly parallel to the rim but canted
slightly towards us.  I even thought I could make out the merest
convexity in the surface itself.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Szpindel smiled faintly at the effect.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
James cleared her throat.  &quot;Not to downplay your concerns,
Isaac, but we've hardly exhausted the diplomatic route.  And at least
it's willing to talk, even if it's not as forthcoming as we'd like.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Sure it talks,&quot; Szpindel said, eyes still on the leaning
mug.  &quot;Not like us.&quot;
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Well, no.  There's some-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;It's not just slippery, it's downright <I>dyslexic</I>
sometimes, you noticed?  And it mixes up its pronouns.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Given that it picked up the language entirely via passive
eavesdropping, it's remarkably fluent.  In fact, from what I can tell
they're more efficient at processing speech than we are.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Gotta be efficient at a language if you're going to be so
<I>evasive</I> in it, eh?&quot;
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;If they were human I might agree with you,&quot; James replied.
 &quot;But what appears to us as evasion or deceit could just as
easily be explained by a reliance on smaller conceptual units.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Conceptual units?&quot;  Bates, I was beginning to realize,
never pulled up a subtitle if she could help it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="font-weight: medium; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
James nodded.  &quot;Like processing a line of text word by word,
instead of looking at complete phrases.  The smaller the units, the
faster they can be reconfigured; it gives you very fast semantic
reflexes.  The down side is that it's difficult to maintain the same
level of logical consistency, since the patterns within the larger
structure are more likely to get shuffled.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;<I>Whoa</I>.&quot;  Szpindel straightened, all thoughts of
liquids and centipetal force forgotten.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;All I'm saying is, we aren't necessarily dealing with
deliberate deception here.  An entity who parses information at one
scale might not be aware of inconsistencies on another; it might not
even have conscious access to that level.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;That's not all you're saying.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Isaac, you can't apply Human norms to a-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I <I>wondered</I> what you were up to.&quot;  Szpindel dove
into the transcripts.  A moment later he dredged up an excerpt:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; margin-left: 0.7in; margin-right: 0.7in; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

&quot;You were <I>testing</I> it!&quot; Szpindel crowed.  He smacked
his lips; his jaw ticced.   You were looking for an emotional
response!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;It was just a thought.  It didn't prove anything.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Was there a difference?  In the response time?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
James hesitated, then shook her head.  &quot;But it was a stupid
idea.  There are so many variables, we have no idea how they-I
mean, they're <I>alien</I>...&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;The pathology's classic.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;What pathology?&quot; I asked.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;It doesn't mean anything except that they're different from the
Human baseline,&quot; James insisted.  &quot;Which is not something
<I>anyone</I> here can look down their nose about.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I tried again:  &quot;What pathology?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
James shook her head.  Szpindel filled me in:  &quot;There's a
syndrome you might have heard about, eh?  Fast talkers, no
conscience, tend to malapropism and self-contradiction.  No emotional
affect.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;We're not talking about human beings here,&quot; James said
again, softly.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;But if we were,&quot; Szpindel added, &quot;we might call
<I>Rorschach</I> a clinical sociopath.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Sarasti had said nothing during this entire exchange.  Now, with the
word hanging out in the open, I noticed that nobody else would look
at him.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
We all knew that Jukka Sarasti was a sociopath, of course.  Most of
us just didn't mention it in polite company.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Szpindel was never that polite.  Or maybe it was just that he seemed
to almost <I>understand</I> Sarasti; he could look behind the monster
and regard the <I>organism</I>, no less a product of natural
selection for all the human flesh it had devoured in eons past.  That
perspective calmed him, somehow.  He could watch Sarasti watching
him, and not flinch.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I feel sorry for the poor son of a bitch,&quot; he said once,
back in training.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Some would have thought that absurd.  This man, so massively
interfaced with machinery that his own motor skills had degraded for
want of proper care and feeding; this man who heard x-rays and saw in
shades of ultrasound, so corrupted by retrofits he could no longer
even feel his own fingertips without assistance-this man could
pity <I>anyone</I> else, let alone an infra-eyed predator built to
murder without the slightest twitch of remorse?</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Empathy for sociopaths isn't common,&quot; I remarked.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Maybe it should be.  We, at least-&quot; he waved an arm;
some remote-linked sensor cluster across the simulator whirred and
torqued reflexively- &quot;<I>chose</I> the add-ons.  Vampires
<I>had</I> to be sociopaths.  They're too much like their own prey-a
lot of taxonomists don't even consider them a subspecies, you know
that?  Never diverged far enough for complete reproductive isolation.
 So maybe they're more syndrome than race.  Just a bunch of obligate
cannibals with a consistent set of deformities.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;And how does that make-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;If the only thing you can eat is your own kind, empathy is
gonna be the <I>first</I> thing that goes.  Psychopathy's no disorder
in <I>those</I> shoes, eh?  Just a survival strategy.  But they still
make our skin crawl, so we-chain 'em up.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;You think we should've repaired the Crucifix glitch?&quot;
Everyone knew why we hadn't.  Only a fool would resurrect a monster
without safeguards in place.  Vampires came with theirs built in:
without his antiEuclideans Sarasti would go <I>grand mal</I> the
first time he caught close sight of a four-panel window frame.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
But Szpindel was shaking his head.  &quot;We couldn't have fixed it.
Or we <I>could</I> have,&quot; he amended, &quot;but the glitch is in
the visual cortex, eh?  Linked to their omnisavantism.  You fix it,
you disable their pattern-matching skills, and then what's the point
in even bringing them back?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I didn't know that.&quot;</P>

&quot;Well, that's the official story.&quot;  He fell silent a
moment, cracked a crooked grin.  &quot;Then again, we didn't have any
trouble fixing the protocadherin pathways when it suited us.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I subtitled.  Context-sensitive, ConSensus served up <I>protocadherin
&gamma;-Y</I>:  the magical hominid brain protein that vampires had
never been able to synthesize.  The reason they hadn't just switched
to zebras or warthogs once denied Human prey, why our discovery of
the terrible secret of the Right Angle had spelled their doom.

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Anyway, I just think he's-cut off.&quot;  A nervous tic
tugged at the corner of Szpindel's mouth.  &quot;Lone wolf, nothing
but sheep for company.  Wouldn't you feel lonely?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;They don't <I>like</I> company,&quot; I reminded him.  You
didn't put vampires of the same sex together, not unless you were
taking bets on a bloodbath.  They were solitary hunters and <I>very
</I>territorial.  With a minimum viable pred-prey ratio of one to
ten-and human prey spread so sparsely across the Pleistocene
landscape-the biggest threat to their survival had been
competition from their own kind.  Natural selection had never taught
them to play nicely together.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

We did it with mirrors, great round parabolic things, each impossibly
thin and three times as high as a man.  <I>Theseus</I> rolled them up
and bolted them to firecrackers stuffed with precious antimatter from
our dwindling stockpiles.  With twelve hours to spare she flung them
like confetti along precise ballistic trajectories, and when they
were safely distant she set them alight.  They pinwheeled off every
which way, gamma sleeting in their wake until they burned dry.  Then

<I>Rorschach</I> fell around Ben barely fifteen hundred kilometers
from atmosphere, a fast endless circle that took just under forty
hours to complete.  By the time it didn't return to our sight, the
mirrors were all outside the zone of total blindness.  A closeup of
Ben's equatorial edge floated in ConSensus.  Mirror icons sparkled

A mirage wavered stage left, a tiny spot of swirling chaos perhaps
half the size of a fingernail held at arms-length.  It told us
nothing, it was pure heat-shimmer-but light bounced towards us
from dozens of distant relayers, and while each saw scarcely more
than our last probe had- a  patch of dark clouds set slightly
awry by some invisible prism- each of those views refracted

First a faint sliver of shadow, a tiny dimple all but lost in the
seething equatorial cloud bands.  It had just barely rotated into

an invisible finger stuck in the clouds, turbulence and shear stress
shredding the boundary layers to either side.</P>

So she did:  and while the Gang spoke with the artefact, the others
spied upon it.  Their vision failed over time-mirrors fell away
along their respective vectors, lines-of-sight degraded with each
passing second-but ConSensus filled with things learned in the
meantime.  <I>Rorschach</I> massed  1.8<SUP>.</SUP>10<SUP>10</SUP> kg
within a total volume of 2.3<SUP>.</SUP>10<SUP>8</SUP> cubic meters.
Its magnetic field, judging by radio squeals and its Plage Effect,
was thousands of times stronger than the sun's.  Astonishingly, parts
of the composite image were clear enough to discern fine spiral
grooves twined around the structure.  (&quot;Fibonacci sequence,&quot;
Szpindel reported, one jiggling eye fixing me for a moment.  &quot;At
least they're not <I>completely</I> alien.&quot;)  Spheroid
protuberances disfigured the tips of at least three of <I>Rorschach</I>'s
innumerable spines; the grooves were more widely spaced in those
areas, like skin grown tight and swollen with infection.  Just before
one vital mirror sailed out of range it glimpsed another spine, split
a third of the way along its length.  Torn material floated flaccid
and unmoving in vacuum.</P>

<I>Rorschach</I> may have been reproducing but beyond a doubt it was
<I>growing</I>, fed by a steady trickle of infalling debris from
Ben's accretion belt.  We were close enough now to get a clear view
of that procession:  rocks and mountains and pebbles fell like
sediment swirling around a drain.  Particles that collided with the
artefact simply <I>stuck</I>;  <I>Rorschach</I> engulfed prey like
some vast metastatic amoeba.  The acquired mass was apparently
processed internally and shunted to apical growth zones; judging by
infinitesimal changes in the artefact's allometry, it grew from the
tips of its branches.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

It was a strange attractor in the interstellar gulf; the paths along
which the rocks fell was precisely and utterly chaotic.  It was as
though some Keplerian Black Belt had set up the whole system like an
astronomical wind-up toy, kicked everything into motion, and let
inertia do the rest.</P>

The stain on the Gang's topology had flickered when Michelle took
over, but it hadn't disappeared.  It grew slightly as Michelle

&quot;It doesn't even have a clue what it's saying <I>back</I>,&quot;
she added.</P>

&quot;Wait a minute.  You said-<I>Susan</I> said they weren't

to-it's not even intelligent?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Oh, it could be intelligent, certainly.  But we're not <I>talking</I>

it a <I>Chinese Room</I>...&quot;</P>

I knew all about Chinese Rooms.  I was one.  I didn't even keep it a
secret, I told anyone who was interested enough to ask.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

&quot;How can you possibly tell the rest of us what your bleeding
edge is up to if you don't understand it yourself?&quot;  Chelsea
demanded back when things were good between us.  Before she got to
know me.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I shrugged. &quot;It's not my <I>job</I> to understand them.  If I
could, they wouldn't be very bleeding-edge in the first place.  I'm
just a, you know, a conduit.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Yeah, but how can you translate something if you <I>don't</I>
understand it?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
A common cry, outside the field.  People simply can't accept that
patterns carry their own intelligence, quite apart from the semantic
content that clings to their surfaces; if you manipulate the topology
correctly, that content just-comes along for the ride.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;You ever hear of the Chinese Room?&quot; I asked.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
She shook her head.  &quot;Only vaguely.  Really old, right?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Hundred years at least.  It's a fallacy really, it's an
argument that supposedly puts the lie to Turing tests.  You stick
some guy in a closed room.  Sheets with strange squiggles come in
through a slot in the wall.  He's got access to this huge database of
squiggles just like it, and a bunch of rules to tell him how to put
those squiggles together.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Grammar,&quot; Chelsea said.  &quot;Syntax.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I nodded.  &quot;The point is, though, he doesn't have any idea what
the squiggles <I>are</I>, or what information they might contain.  He
only knows that when he encounters squiggle <I>delta</I>, say, he's
supposed to extract the fifth and sixth squiggles from file <I>theta</I>
and put them together with another squiggle from <I>gamma</I>.  So he
builds this response string, puts it on the sheet, slides it back out
the slot and takes a nap until the next iteration.  Repeat until the
remains of the horse are well and thoroughly beaten.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;So he's carrying on a conversation,&quot; Chelsea said.  &quot;In
Chinese, I assume, or they would have called it the Spanish
Inquisition.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Exactly.  Point being you can use basic pattern-matching
algorithms to participate in a conversation <I>without having any
idea what you're saying</I>.  Depending on how good your rules are,
you can pass a Turing test.  You can be a wit and raconteur in a
language you don't even speak.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;That's synthesis?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Only the part that involves downscaling semiotic protocols.
And only in principle.  And I'm actually getting my input in
Cantonese and replying in German, because I'm more of a conduit than
a conversant.  But you get the idea.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;How do you keep all the rules and protocols straight?  There
must be millions of them.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;It's like anything else.  Once you learn the rules, you do it
unconsciously.  Like riding a bike, or pinging the noosphere.  You
don't actively think about the protocols at all, you just-<I>imagine</I>
how your targets behave.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Mmm.&quot;  A subtle half-smile played at the corner of her
mouth.  &quot;But-the argument's not really a fallacy then, is
it?  It's spot-on:  you really <I>don't</I> understand Cantonese or
German.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;The <I>system</I> understands.  The whole Room, with all its
parts.  The guy who does the scribbling is just one component.  You
wouldn't expect a single neuron in your head to understand English,
would you?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Sometimes one's all I can spare.&quot;  Chelsea shook her head.
 She wasn't going to let it go.  I could see her sorting questions in
order of priority; I could see them getting increasingly-personal-</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;To get back to the matter at hand,&quot; I said, preempting
them all, &quot;you were going to show me how to do that thing with
the fingers-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
A wicked grin wiped the questions right off her face.  &quot;Oooh,
that's <I>right</I>-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
It's risky, getting involved.  Too many confounds.  Every tool in the

you're observing.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Now we go in.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
It wasn't news so much as review:  we'd been straight-lining towards
Ben for days now.  But perhaps the Chinese Room Hypothesis had
strengthened his resolve.  At any rate, with <I>Rorschach</I> in
eclipse once more, we prepared to take intrusiveness to the next
level.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<I>Theseus</I> was perpetually gravid; a generic probe incubated in
her fabrication plant, its development arrested just short of birth
in anticipation of unforeseen mission requirements.  Sometime between
briefings the Captain had brought it to parturition, customized for
close contact and ground work.  It burned down the well at high gee a
good ten hours before <I>Rorschach</I>'s next scheduled appearance,
inserted itself into the rock stream, and went to sleep.  If our
calculations were in order, it would not be smashed by some errant
piece of debris before it woke up again.  If all went well, an
intelligence that had precisely orchestrated a cast of millions would
not notice one extra dancer on the floor.  If we were just plain
lucky, the myriad high-divers that happened to be line-of-sight at
the time were not programmed as tattletales.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Acceptable risks. If we hadn't been up for them, we might as well
have stayed home.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
And so we waited:  four optimized hybrids somewhere past the
threshold of mere humanity, one extinct predator who'd opted to
command us instead of eating us alive.  We waited for <I>Rorschach</I>
to come back around the bend.  The probe fell smoothly around the
well, an ambassador to the unwilling-or, if the Gang was right,
maybe just a back-door artist set to B&amp;E an empty condo.
Szpindel had named it <I>Jack-in-the-box</I>, after some antique
child's toy that didn't even rate a listing in ConSensus;  we fell in
its wake, nearly ballistic now, momentum and inertia carefully
precalculated to thread us through the chaotic minefield of Ben's
accretion belt.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Kepler couldn't do it all, though;  <I>Theseus</I> grumbled briefly
now and then, the intermittent firing of her attitude jets rumbling
softly up the spine as the  Captain tweaked our descent into the
Maelstrom.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

&quot;Got it,&quot; Bates said.  A speck appeared at Ben's edge; the
display zoomed instantly to closeup.  &quot;Proximity boot.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<I>Rorschach</I> remained invisible to <I>Theseus</I>, close as we
were, close as we were coming.  But parallax stripped at least some
of the scales from the probe's eyes; it woke to spikes and spirals of
smoky glass flickering in and out of view, Ben's flat endless horizon
semivisible through the intervening translucence.  The view trembled;
waveforms rippled across ConSensus.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Quite the magnetic field,&quot; Szpindel remarked.</P>

Coasting now, Jack-<I>sneezed</I>.  Silver chaff shot into the
void towards the target:  millions of compass needles, brilliantly
reflective, fast enough to make <I>Theseus</I> seem slow.   They were
gone in an instant.  The probe watched them flee, swept laser eyes
across every degree of arc, scanned its sky twice a second and took
careful note of each and every reflective flash.  Only at first did
those needles shoot along anything approaching a straight line: then
they swept abruptly into Lorentz spirals, twisted into sudden arcs
and corkscrews, shot away along new and intricate trajectories
bordering on the relativistic.  The contours of <I>Rorschach</I>'s
magnetic field resolved in ConSensus, at first glance like the nested
layers of a glass onion.</P>

&quot;She's got a more casual affect than <I>he</I> ever did.&quot;
Sascha glanced up at Sarasti, and did not add <I>You sure about this?</I>
 She was starting to wonder herself, though.  Starting to dwell on
the potential consequences of being <I>wrong</I>, now that we were
committed.  As far as sober second thought was concerned it was too

Great hoops were resolving in <I>Rorschach</I>'s magnetosphere.
Invisible to human eyes, their outlines were vanishingly faint even
on Tactical;  the chaff had scattered so thinly across the sky that
even the Captain was resorting to guesswork.  The new macrostructures
hovered in the magnetosphere like the nested gimbals of some great

By now the probe coasted just a few kilometers off <I>Rorschach</I>'s
leading edge.  That close it served up way more than magnetic fields:
 it presented <I>Rorschach</I> itself in bright, tactical color

&quot;Just had to reacquire the laser.&quot;  The probe had been

caught in sudden undertow and thrown over a waterfall-but it
was still talking, and still mobile.</P>

Barely.   Bates struggled to stay the course.  Jack staggered and

strobed.

Jack was deep in the forest.  We'd lost most of the tactical overlays
to reduced baud.  In dim visible light <I>Rorschach</I>'s great
ridged spines, each the size of a skyscraper, hashed a nightmare view
on all sides.  The feed stuttered as Bates struggled to keep the beam

Imagine a crown of thorns, twisted, dark and unreflective, grown too

They never sealed the hatch behind them.  It was too easy to get lost
up there in the dome, naked infinite space stretching a hundred
eighty degrees on every axis.  They needed all that emptiness but
they needed an anchor in its midst:  soft stray light from astern, a
gentle draft from the drum, the sounds of people and machinery close
by.  They needed to have it both ways.</P>

&quot;At least the shielding held,&quot; Szpindel said finally.
&quot;That's something.&quot;  He wasn't just talking about Jack; our
own carapace was coated with the same stuff now.  It had depleted our
substrate stockpiles by two thirds, but no one wanted to rely on the

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

&quot;If you said that, it would be.  But I'm saying it, so it's game
theory.&quot;</P>

&quot;Game theory again.  Jesus, Isaac.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;No, listen.  You're thinking about the aliens like they were
some kind of mammal.  Something that <I>cares</I>, something that
looks after its investments.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;How do you know they aren't?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Because you can't protect your kids when they're lightyears
away.  They're on their own, and it's a big cold dangerous universe
so most of them aren't going to make it, eh?  The most you can do is
crank out <I>millions</I> of kids, take cold comfort in knowing that
a few always luck out through random chance.  It's not a mammal
mind-set, Meesh.  You want an earthbound simile, think of dandelion
seeds.  Or, or herring.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
A soft sigh.  &quot;So they're interstellar herring.  That hardly
means they can't crush us.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;But they don't know about <I>us</I>, not in advance.  Dandelion
seed doesn't know what it's up against before it sprouts.  Maybe
nothing.  Maybe some spastic weed that goes over like straw in the
wind.  Or maybe something that kicks its ass halfway to the
Magellanic Clouds.  It doesn't <I>know</I>, and there's no such thing
as a one-size-fits-all survival strategy.  Something that aces
against one player blows goats against a different one.  So the best
you can do is mix up your strategies based on the odds.  It's a
weighted dice roll and it gives you the best mean payoff over the
whole game, but you're bound to crap out and choose the wrong
strategy at least some of the time.  Price of doing business.  And
that means-<I>that</I> means-that weak players not only
<I>can</I> win against stronger ones, but they're statistically <I>bound</I>
to in some cases.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Michelle snorted.  &quot;<I>That's</I> your game theory?  Rock Paper
Scissors with statistics?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Maybe Szpindel didn't know the reference.  He didn't speak, long
enough to call up a subtitle; then he brayed like a horse.  &quot;<I>Rock
Paper Scissors</I>!  Yes!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Michelle digested that for a moment.  &quot;You're sweet for trying,
but that only works if the other side is just blindly playing the
odds, and they don't have to <I>do</I> that if they know who they're
going up against in advance.  And my dear, they have so very much
information about <I>us</I>...&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
They'd threatened Susan.  By name.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;They don't know everything,&quot; Szpindel insisted.  &quot;And
the principle works for <I>any</I> scenario involving incomplete
information, not just the ignorant extreme.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Not as well.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;But <I>some</I>, and that gives us a chance.  Doesn't matter
how good you are at poker when it comes to the deal, eh?  Cards still
deal out with the same odds.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;So that's what we're playing.  Poker.&quot;</P>

&quot;Yup.  And you can't make an informed guess without data, eh?

We'd fallen so far that the naked eye didn't see a disk, barely even
saw curvature<I> </I>any more.  We were falling towards a <I>wall</I>,
a vast roiling expanse of dark thunderclouds that extended in all
directions to some new, infinitely-distant horizon.  Ben filled half
the universe.</P>

Far below, Jack clung to <I>Rorschach</I>'s ridged surface with
bristly gecko-feet fenders and set up camp.  It sent x-rays and
ultrasound into the ground, tapped enquiring fingers and listened to
the echos, planted tiny explosive charges and measured the resonance
of their detonations.  It shed seeds like pollen: tiny probes and
sensors by the thousands, self-powered, near-sighted, stupid and
expendable.  The vast majority were sacrificial offerings to random
chance; only one in a hundred lasted long enough to return usable
telemetry.</P>

While our advance scout took measure of its local neighborhood,
<I>Theseus</I> drew larger-scale birdseye maps from the closing sky.
It spat out thousands of its own disposable probes, spread them
across the heavens and collected stereoscopic data from a thousand
simultaneous perspectives.</P>

Patchwork insights assembled in the drum.  <I>Rorschach</I>'s skin
was sixty percent superconducting carbon nanotube. <I>Rorschach</I>'s
guts were largely hollow; at least some of those hollows appeared to
contain an atmosphere.  No earthly form of life would have lasted a
second in there, though;  intricate topographies of  radiation and
electromagnetic force seethed around the structure, seethed within
it.  In some places the radiation was intense enough to turn
unshielded flesh to ash in an instant; calmer backwaters would merely
kill in the same span of time.  Charged particles raced around
invisible racetracks at relativistic speeds, erupting from jagged
openings, hugging curves of magnetic force strong enough for neutron
stars, arcing through open space and plunging back into black mass.
Occasional protuberances swelled and burst and released clouds of
microparticulates, seeding the radiation belts like spores.
<I>Rorschach</I> resembled nothing so much as a nest of half-naked
cyclotrons, tangled one with another.</P>

Neither Jack below nor <I>Theseus</I> above could find any points of
entry, beyond those impassable gaps that spat out streams of charged
particles or swallowed them back down.  No airlocks or hatches or
viewports resolved with increasing proximity.  The fact that we'd
been threatened via laser beam implied some kind of optical antennae
or tightcast array; we weren't even able to find that much.</P>

A central hallmark of von Neumann machines was self-replication.
Whether <I>Rorschach</I> would meet that criterion-whether it
would germinate, or divide, or give birth when it passed some
critical threshold-whether it had done so already-remained
an open question.

One of a thousand.  At the end of it all-after all the
measurements, the theorizing and deduction and outright guesswork-we
settled into orbit with a million trivial details and no answers.  In
terms of the big questions, there was only one thing we knew for
sure.</P>

&quot;I guess that's the whole point,&quot; Bates said.  She had no
one to confide in, partook of no intimate dialogs that could be

<I>Theseus</I> was birthing a litter, two by two.  They were
nasty-looking things, armored, squashed egg-shapes, twice the size of
a human torso and studded with gardening implements: antennae,
optical ports, retractable threadsaws.  Weapons muzzles.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Bates was summoning her troops.  We floated before the primary fab
port at the base of <I>Theseus</I>' spine.  The plant could just as
easily have disgorged the grunts directly into the hold beneath the
carapace-that was where they'd be stored anyway, until called
upon-but Bates was giving each a visual inspection before
sending it through one of the airlocks a few meters up the
passageway.  Ritual, perhaps.  Military tradition.  Certainly there
was nothing she could see with her eyes that wouldn't be glaringly
obvious to the most basic diagnostic.</P>

<I>Theseus</I> growled, giving us more attitude.  The plating
trembled to stern; another piece of local debris, no longer in our
path.  We were angling towards an equatorial orbit just a few
miniscule kilometers above the artefact; insanely, the approach
curved right through the accretion belt.</P>

It didn't bother the others. &quot;Like surviving traffic in a high
speed lane,&quot; Sascha had said, disdainful of my misgivings.  &quot;Try
creeping across and you're road kill.  Gotta speed up, go with the
flow.&quot;  But the flow was turbulent; we hadn't gone five minutes
without a course correction since <I>Rorschach</I> had stopped
talking to us.

&quot;Sarasti doesn't <I>guess</I>,&quot; Bates said.  &quot;The

his orders, given we're all about a hundred IQ points short of

vampires were far from the first to learn the virtues of energy

elephant seals lurked breathless at the bottom of the sea, rousing
only for passing prey or redline lactate levels.  Bears and chipmunks
cut costs by sleeping away the impoverished winter months, and
lungfish-Devonian black belts in the art of estivation-could
curl up and die for years, waiting for the rains.</P>

With vampires it was a little different.  It wasn't shortness of
breath, or metabolic overdrive, or some blanket of snow that locked
the pantry every winter.  The problem wasn't so much a lack of prey
as a lack of <I>difference</I> from it; vampires were such a recent
split from the ancestral baseline that the reproductive rates hadn't
diverged.  This was no woodland-variety lynx-hare dynamic, where prey
outnumbered predators a hundred to one.  Vampires fed on things that
bred barely faster than they did.  They would have wiped out their
own food supply in no time if they hadn't learned how to ease off on
the throttle.</P>

It made two kinds of sense.  It not only slashed their metabolic

It was murder on our ancestors, even if those same enemy

a half-million years later.  But it was almost-heartening, I

some aversion to prolonged visibility shaped by generations of

<I>Rorschach</I> described a perfect equatorial circle 87,900 km from
Big Ben's center of gravity.  Sarasti was unwilling to let it out of

At the same time, all the debate over whether or not <I>Rorschach</I>
had meant-or even understood-the threats it had made was
a bit beside the point.  Counterintrusion measures were a distinct
possibility either way, and ongoing proximity only increased the
risk.  So Sarasti had derived some optimum compromise, a mildly
eccentric orbit that nearly brushed the artefact at perigee but kept
a discreet distance the rest of the time.  It was a longer trajectory
than <I>Rorschach</I>'s, and higher-we<I> </I>had to burn on

Because Heaven had a catch.  No matter how many constructs and
avatars Helen built in there, no matter how many empty vessels sang
her praises or commiserated over the injustices she'd suffered, when
it came right down to it she was only talking to herself.  There were
other realities over which she had no control, other people who
didn't play by her rules-and if they thought of Helen at all,
they thought as they damn well pleased.</P>

She could go the rest of her life without ever meeting any of them.

there was only be one way my mother would ever be truly happy in her

Not that we hadn't tried.  Once Jack's sensor head had been
irreparably fried, we'd relegated it to surface excavation; it had
widened the bore in infinitesimal increments, patiently burning back
the edges of our initial peephole until it measured almost a meter
across.  Meanwhile we'd customized Bates's grunts-shielded them
against nuclear reactors and the insides of cyclotrons-and come
perigee we'd thrown them at <I>Rorschach</I> like stones chucked into
a haunted forest.  Each had gone through Jack's portal, unspooling
whisker-thin fiberop behind them to pass intelligence through the
charged atmosphere.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
They'd sent glimpses, mostly.  A few extended vignettes.   We'd seen
<I>Rorschach</I>'s walls move, slow lazy waves of peristalsis
rippling along its gut.   We'd seen treacly invaginations in
progress, painstaking constrictions that would presumably, given
time, seal off a passageway.   Our grunts had sailed through some
quarters, staggered through others where the magnetic ambience threw
them off balance.   They'd passed through strange throats lined with
razor-thin teeth, thousands of triangular blades in parallel rows,
helically twisted.  They'd edged cautiously around clouds of mist
sculpted into abstract fractal shapes, shifting and endlessly
recursive, their charged droplets strung along a myriad converging
lines of  electromagnetic force.

Szpindel gave me a look.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;We've shielded everything except the sensor heads,&quot; Bates
explained.  &quot;If we shield <I>those</I> we're blind.&quot;</P>

&quot;But aren't there, you know-&quot;  I groped for the word-

He snorted.  &quot;Sure.  It's called an atmosphere, and if we'd
brought one with us-about fifty times deeper than Earth's-
it <I>might</I> block some of that soup down there.  Course, Earth
also gets a lot of help from its magnetic field, but I'm not betting

Szpindel's shrug was half shiver.  &quot;I don't think anything about

The conditional was pure formality.  We'd tried playing the odds,
sacrificing drone after drone in the hope that one of them would get
lucky; survival rates tailed exponentially to zero with distance from
base camp.  We'd tried shielding the fiberop to reduce aperture
leakage;  the resulting tethers were stiff and unwieldy, wrapped in
so many layers of ferroceramic that we were virtually waving the bots
around on the end of a stick.  We'd tried cutting the tethers
entirely, sending the machines out to explore on their own, squinting
against the radiant blizzard and storing their findings for later
download; none had returned.  We'd tried everything.</P>

&quot;We were probably fractured during most of our evolution,&quot;
James once told me, back when we were all still getting acquainted.
She tapped her temple.  &quot;There's a lot of room up here;  a
modern brain can run dozens of sentient cores without getting too
crowded.  And parallel multitasking has obvious survival advantages.&quot;</P>

It hadn't been the tone most of us were looking for at an

But I hadn't heard any of the Gang use <I>alter</I> to describe each
other, then or since.  It had seemed innocuous enough when Szpindel
had said it.  I wondered why they'd taken such offence-and now,
floating alone in my tent with a few pre-op minutes to kill, there
was no one to see my eyes glaze.</P>

<I>Alter</I> carried baggage over a century old, ConSensus told me.
Sascha was right; there'd been a time when MCC was MPD, a <I>Disorder</I>
rather than a <I>Complex</I>, and it had <I>never</I> been induced
deliberately.  According to the experts of that time, multiple
personalities arose spontaneously from unimaginable cauldrons of
abuse-fragmentary personae offered up to suffer rapes and
beatings while the child behind took to some unknowable sanctuary in
the folds of the brain.  It was both survival strategy and ritual
self-sacrifice:  powerless souls hacking themselves to pieces,
offering up quivering chunks of self in the desperate hope that the
vengeful gods called <I>Mom</I> or <I>Dad</I> might not be
insatiable.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
None of it had been real, as it turned out.  Or at least, none of it
had been confirmed.  The experts of the day had been little more than
witch doctors dancing through improvised rituals:  meandering
free-form interviews full of leading questions and nonverbal cues,
scavenger hunts through regurgitated childhoods.  Sometimes a shot of
lithium or haloperidol when the beads and rattles didn't work.  The
technology to map minds was barely off the ground; the technology to
edit them was years away.  So the <I>therapists</I> and <I>psychiatrists</I>
poked at their victims and invented names for things they didn't
understand, and argued over the shrines of Freud and Klein and the
old Astrologers.  Doing their very best to sound like practitioners
of Science.

Inevitably, it was Science that turned them all into road kill; MPD
was a half-forgotten fad even before the advent of synaptic rewiring.
 But <I>alter</I> was a word from that time, and its resonance had
persisted.  Among those who remembered the tale, <I>alter</I> was
codespeak for <I>betrayal</I> and <I>human sacrifice</I>.  <I>Alter</I>
meant <I>cannon fodder</I>.</P>

Imagining the topology of the Gang's coexisting souls, I could see
why Sascha embraced the mythology.  I could see why Susan let her.
After all, there was nothing implausible about the concept; the
Gang's very existence proved that much.  And when you've been peeled
off from a pre-existing entity, sculpted from nonexistence straight
into adulthood-a mere fragment of personhood, without even a
full-time body to call your own-you can be forgiven a certain
amount of anger.  Sure you're all equal, all in it together.  Sure,
no persona is better than any other.  Susan's still the only one with
a surname.</P>

Better to direct that resentment at old grudges, real or imagined;

the same flesh.</P>

I realized something else, too.  Surrounded by displays documenting
the relentless growth of the leviathan beneath us, I could not only
see why Sascha had objected to the word; I could also see why Isaac
Szpindel, no doubt unconsciously, had spoken it in the first place.</P>

There were the rest of us, though, crammed into the shuttle, embedded
in custom spacesuits so padded with shielding we might have been
deep-sea divers from a previous century.  It was a fine balance; too

just out of sight, a ravenous <I>mouth</I> as wide as the tunnel
itself. Any moment now it would lunge forward at impossible speed and
engulf us all.</P>

&quot;They're <I>beautiful</I>...&quot; James said.  There was no
fear in her voice at all.  She sounded awestruck.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;What?  Where?&quot;  Bates never stopped turning, kept trying
to keep the whole three-sixty in sight at once.  The drones under her
command wobbled restlessly to either side, armored parentheses
pointing down the passageway in opposite directions.  &quot;What do
you see?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Not out <I>there</I>.  In <I>here</I>.  <I>Everywhere</I>.
Can't you see it?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I can't see anything,&quot; Szpindel said, his voice shaking.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;It's in the EM fields,&quot; James said.  &quot;<I>That's</I>
how they communicate.  The whole structure is full of <I>language</I>,
it's-&quot;</P>

&quot;I can't see <I>anything</I>,&quot; Szpindel repeated.  His
breath echoed loud and fast over the link. &quot;I'm <I>blind</I>.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;<I>Shit.</I>&quot;  Bates swung on Szpindel.  &quot;How can
that-the radiation-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Nine Tesla, and the ghosts were everywhere.  I smelled asphalt and
honeysuckle.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Keeton!&quot;  Bates called.  &quot;You with us?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Y-yeah.&quot;  Barely.  I was back at the bell, my hand on the
ripcord.  Trying to ignore whatever kept tapping me on the shoulder.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Leave that!  Get him outside!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;No!&quot; Szpindel floated helplessly in the passage, his
pistol bouncing against its wrist tether.  &quot;No, throw me
something.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;What?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

&quot;Throw something!  Anything!&quot;
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Bates hesitated.  &quot;You said you were bli-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;<I>Just do it!</I>&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Bates pulled a spare suit battery off her belt and lobbed it.
Szpindel reached, fumbled.  The battery slipped from his grasp and
bounced off the wall.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I'll be okay,&quot; he gasped.  &quot;Just get me into the
tent.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I yanked the cord.  The bell inflated  like a great gunmetal
marshmallow.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Everyone inside!&quot; Bates ran her pistol with one hand,
grabbed Szpindel with the other.  She handed him off to me and
slapped a sensor pod onto the skin of the tent.  I pulled back the
shielded entrance flap as though pulling a scab from a wound.  The
single molecule beneath, infinitely long, endlessly folded against
itself, swirled and glistened like a soap bubble.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Get him in.  James!  Get down here!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I pushed Szpindel through the membrane.  It split around him with
airtight intimacy, hugged each tiny crack and contour as he passed
through.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;<I>James</I>!  Are you-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;<I>Get it off me!</I>&quot;  Harsh voice, raw and scared and
scary, as male as female could sound. Cruncher in control. &quot;<I>Get
it off!</I>&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I looked back.  Susan James' body tumbled slowly in the tunnel,
grasping its right leg with both hands.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;<I>James!</I>&quot;  Bates sailed over to the other woman.
&quot;Keeton! Help out!&quot;  She took the Gang by the arm.
&quot;Cruncher?  What's the problem?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;<I>That!</I> You <I>blind</I>?&quot;  He wasn't just <I>grasping</I>
at the limb, I realized as I joined them.  He was <I>tugging</I> at
it.  <I>He was trying to pull it off.</I></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Something laughed hysterically, right inside my helmet.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Take his arm,&quot; Bates told me, taking his right one, trying
to pry the fingers from their death grip on the Gang's leg.
&quot;Cruncher, <I>let go</I>.  <I>Now.</I>&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;<I>Get it off me!</I>&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;It's your leg, Cruncher.&quot;  We wrestled our way towards the
diving bell.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;It's <I>not</I> my leg!  Just <I>look</I> at it, how could
it-it's <I>dead</I>.  It's <I>stuck</I> to me...&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Almost there.  &quot;Cruncher, <I>listen</I>,&quot; Bates snapped.
&quot;Are you with m-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;<I>Get it off!</I>&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
We stuffed the Gang into the tent.  Bates moved aside as I dove in
after them.  Amazing, the way she held it together.  Somehow she kept
the demons at bay, herded us to shelter like a border collie in a
thunderstorm.  She was-</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
She wasn't following us in.  She wasn't even <I>there</I>.  I turned
to see her body floating outside the tent, one gloved hand grasping
the edge of the flap; but even under all those layers of Kapton and
Chromel and polycarbonate, even behind the distorted half-reflections
on her faceplate, I could tell that something was missing.  All her
surfaces had just <I>disappeared.</I>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
This couldn't be Amanda Bates.  The thing before me had no more
topology than a mannequin.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Amanda?&quot;  The Gang gibbered at my back, softly hysteric.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Szpindel:  &quot;What's happening?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I'll stay out here,&quot; Bates said.  She had no affect
whatsoever.  &quot;I'm dead anyway.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

It wasn't the first time, not for me.  I'd had invisible fingers
poking through my brain before, stirring up the muck, ripping open
the scabs.  It was far more intense when <I>Rorschach</I> did it to
me, but Chelsea was more-</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
-precise, I guess you'd say.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Macram-, she called it:  glial jumpstarts, cascade effects,
the splice and dice of critical ganglia.  While I trafficked in the
reading of Human architecture, Chelsea <I>changed</I> it-finding
the critical nodes and nudging them just so, dropping a pebble into
some trickle at the headwaters of memory and watching the ripples
build to a great rolling cascade deep in the downstream psyche.  She
could hotwire happiness in the time it took to fix a sandwich,
reconcile you with your whole childhood in the course of a lunch hour
or three.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Like so many other domains of human invention, this one had learned
to run without her.  Human nature was becoming an assembly-line edit,
Humanity itself increasingly relegated from Production to product.
Still.  For me, Chelsea's skill set recast a strange old world in an
entirely new light:  the cut-and-paste of minds not for the greater
good of some abstract society, but for the simple selfish wants of
the individual.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Let me give you the gift of happiness,&quot; she said.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I'm already pretty happy.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I'll make you happier.  A TAT, on me.&quot;</P>

&quot;Tat?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Transient Attitudinal Tweak.  I've still got privileges at
Sax.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I've been tweaked plenty.  Change one more synapse and I might
turn into someone else.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;That's ridiculous and you know it.  Or every experience you had
would turn you into a different person.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I thought about that.  &quot;Maybe it does.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
But she wouldn't let it go, and even the strongest anti-happiness
argument was bound to be an uphill proposition; so one afternoon
Chelsea fished around in her cupboards and dredged up a hair-net
studded with greasy gray washers.  The net was a superconducting
spiderweb, fine as mist, that mapped the fields of merest thought.
The washers were ceramic magnets that bathed the brain in fields of
their own.   Chelsea's inlays linked to a base station that played
with the interference patterns between the two.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;They used to need a machine the size of a bathroom just to
house the magnets.&quot;  She laid me back on the couch and stretched
the mesh across my skull.  &quot;That's the only outright miracle you
get with a portable setup like this.  We can find hot spots, and we
can even zap 'em if they need zapping, but TMS effects fade after a
while.  We'll have to go to a clinic for anything permanent.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;So we're fishing for what, exactly?  Repressed memories?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;No such thing.&quot;  She grinned in toothy reassurance.
&quot;There are only memories we choose to ignore, or kinda think
<I>around</I>, if you know what I mean.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I thought this was the gift of happiness.  Why-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
She laid a fingertip across my lips. &quot;Believe it or not,
Cyggers, people sometimes choose to ignore even <I>good</I> memories.
 Like, say, if they enjoyed something they didn't think they should.
Or-&quot; she kissed my forehead- &quot;if they don't
think they <I>deserve</I> to be happy.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;So we're going for-&quot;</P>

&quot;Potluck.  You can never tell 'til you get a bite.  Close your

A soft hum started up somewhere between my ears.  Chelsea's voice led
me on through the darkness.  &quot;Now keep in mind, memories aren't
historical archives.   They're-improvisations, really.  A lot
of the stuff you associate with a particular event might be factually
wrong, no matter how clearly you remember it.  The brain has a funny
habit of building composites.  Inserting details after the fact.  But
that's not to say your memories aren't <I>true</I>, okay?  They're
an honest reflection of how you saw the world, and every one of them
went into shaping how you <I>see</I> it.  But they're not
photographs.  More like impressionist paintings.  Okay?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Okay.&quot;</P>

&quot;What?&quot;</P>

&quot;Functional cluster. Getting a lot of low-level use but not

happens when we-&quot;</P>

And I was ten years old, and I was home early and I'd just let myself
into the kitchen and the smell of burned butter and garlic hung in
the air.  Dad and Helen were fighting in the next room.  The flip-top
on our kitchen-catcher had been left up, which was sometimes enough
to get Helen going all by itself.  But they were fighting about
something else; Helen <I>only wanted what was best for all of us</I>
but Dad said <I>there were limits</I> and <I>this was not the way to
go about it</I>.  And Helen said <I>you don't know what it's like you
hardly ever even </I>see<I> him</I> and then I knew they were
fighting about me.  Which in and of itself was nothing unusual.</P>

&quot;You do not <I>force</I> something like that onto someone.

The Gang floated quietly, cheek-to-jowl behind Szpindel in the
cramped enclosure.  Cruncher had stopped obsessing about the leg as
soon as we'd sealed up.  Or maybe he'd simply been overridden; I
thought I saw facets of Susan in the twitching of those thick gloved
fingers.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

against the skin of the tent.  He felt back and forth along the
fabric.  &quot;Someone <I>did</I> put out a transducer-&quot;</P>

&quot;Eight o'clock,&quot; I said.  &quot;About a meter.&quot;
Szpindel's hand came to rest across the wall from the pod.  My HUD
flooded with second-hand numbers, vibrated down his arm and relayed
to our suits.

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Do you-exist?&quot; I asked.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;What kind of stupid question is that?  Szpindel, how's this
field strength?  Can we work in it?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Uh...&quot; He swallowed audibly. &quot;Maybe we should abort,
Major.  That spike was-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;According to my readings, the spike is pretty much over.  And
we've got less than two hours to finish setting up, run our ground
truths, and get out of here.  Can we do that without hallucinating?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I don't think we'll shake the heebie-jeebies,&quot; Szpindel
admitted.  &quot;But we shouldn't have to worry about -extreme
effects- until another spike hits.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Good.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Which could be any time.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;We weren't hallucinating,&quot;  James said quietly.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;We can discuss it later,&quot; Bates said.  &quot;Now-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;There was a pattern there,&quot; James insisted.  &quot;In the
fields.  In my head.  <I>Rorschach</I> was talking.  Maybe not to us,
but it was talking.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Good.&quot;  Bates pushed herself back to let us pass.  &quot;Maybe
now we can finally learn to talk back.&quot;</P>

We fled like frightened children with brave faces.  We left a base
camp behind:  Jack, still miraculously functional in its vestibule; a
tunnel into the haunted mansion; forlorn magnetometers left to die in
the faint hope they might not.  Crude pyronometers and thermographs,
antique radiation-proof devices that measured the world through the
flex and stretch of metal tabs and etched their findings on rolls of
plastic.  Glow-globes and diving bells and guide ropes strung one to
another.  We left it all behind, and promised to return in thirty-six
hours if we lived so long.</P>

Inside each of us, infinitesimal lacerations were turning our cells
to mush.  Plasma membranes sprang countless leaks.  Overwhelmed
repair enzymes clung desperately to shredded genes and barely delayed
the inevitable.  Anxious to avoid the rush, patches of my intestinal
lining began flaking away before the rest of the body had a chance to
die.</P>

By the time we docked with <I>Theseus</I> both Michelle and I were
feeling nauseous.  (The rest of the Gang, oddly, was not; I had no
idea how that was possible.)  The others would be presenting the same
symptoms within minutes.  Without intervention we would all be
vomiting our guts out for the following two days.  Then the body
would pretend to recover;  for perhaps a week we would feel no pain
and have no future.  We would walk and talk and move like any living
thing, and perhaps convince ourselves that we were immortal after
all.

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Then we would collapse into ourselves, rotted from the inside out.
We would bleed from our eyes and mouths and assholes, and if any God
was merciful we would die before splitting open like rotten fruit.</P>

But of course <I>Theseus</I>, our redeemer, would save us from such a
fate.  We filed from the shuttle into a great balloon that Sarasti
had erected to capture our personal effects; we shed our contaminated
space suits and clothing and emerged naked into the spine.  We passed
single-file through the drum, the Flying Dead in formation.  Jukka
Sarasti-discreetly distant on the turning floor-leapt up
in our wake and disappeared aft, to feed our radioactive cast-offs
into the decompiler.</P>

I woke up ravenous.  Faint voices drifted forward from the drum.  I
floated in my pod for a few moments, eyes closed, savoring absences:
no pain, no nausea.  No terrifying subliminal sense of one's own body
sloughing incrementally to mush.  Weakness, and hunger; otherwise I
felt fine.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I opened my eyes.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Something like an arm.  Grey and glistening, far too- too
<I>attenuate</I> to be human.  No hand at its tip.  Too many joints,
a limb broken in a dozen places.  It extended from a body barely
visible over the lip of the pod, a suggestion of dark bulk and other
limbs in disjoint motion.  It hovered motionless before me, as if
startled in the midst of some shameful act.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
By the time I had breath enough to cry out, it had whipped back out
of sight.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I erupted from the pod, eyes everywhere.  Now they saw nothing:  an
empty crypt, a naked note-taker.  The mirrored bulkhead reflected
vacant pods to either side.  I called up ConSensus:  all systems
nominal.

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I headed aft, heart still pounding.  The drum opened around me,
Szpindel and the Gang conversing in low tones aft.  Szpindel glanced
up and waved a trembling hand in greeting.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

&quot;Admitting you have a problem is the first step,&quot; Szpindel
called back.  &quot;Just don't expect miracles.&quot;  He turned back
to the Gang;  James on top, they sat in a diagnostic couch staring at
some test pattern shimmering on the rear bulkhead.

I grabbed the tip of a stairway and pulled myself down.  Coriolis
pushed me sideways like a flag in the breeze.  &quot;I'm either
hallucinating or there's something on board.&quot;</P>

the signs, I could see he wasn't even surprised.</P>

&quot;Guess you're pretty hungry after all that exhausting lying
around, eh?&quot;  Szpindel waved at the galley.  &quot;Eat
something.  Be with you in a few minutes.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
  I forced myself to work up my latest synopsis while I ate, but that
only took half a mind; the other still shivered in residual thrall to
fight-flight.  I tried to distract it by tapping the BioMed feed.</P>

&quot;It was <I>real</I>,&quot;  James was saying.  &quot;We all saw

The feed showed what she saw:  a small black triangle on a white
background.  In the next instant it shattered into a dozen identical
copies, and a dozen dozen.  The proliferating brood rotated around
the center screen, geometric primitives ballroom-dancing in precise
formation, each sprouting smaller triangles from its tips,
fractalizing, rotating, <I>evolving</I> into an infinite, intricate
tilework...</P>

A sketchpad, I realized.  An interactive eyewitness reconstruction,
without the verbiage.  Susan's own pattern-matching wetware reacted
to what she saw- <I>no, there were more of them; no, the
orientation's wrong; yes, that's it, but bigger</I>- and
Szpindel's machine picked those reactions right out of her head and
amended the display in realtime.   It was a big step up from that
half-assed workaround called <I>language.</I>  The easily-impressed
might have even called it mind-reading.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
It wasn't, though.  It was all just feedback and correlation.  It
doesn't take a telepath to turn one set of patterns into another.
Fortunately.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I did.  &quot;I wasn't talking about back in <I>Rorschach</I>, you

He eyed the blood-filled cuvette between his thumb and forefinger:  a

Szpindel nodded.  &quot;Call it a quality-control test.  Keep the
ship on its toes.&quot;  He dropped the sample onto the nearest
countertop.  The teardrop flattened and burst; the surface drank my
blood  as if parched.  Szpindel smacked his lips.  &quot;Elevated
cholinesterase inhibitors in the ret.  Yum.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
For all I knew, my blood results actually <I>did</I> taste good to
the man.  Szpindel didn't just read results; he <I>felt</I> them,
smelled and saw and <I>experienced</I> each datum like drops of
citrus on the tongue.  The whole BioMed subdrum was but a part of the
Szpindel prosthesis:  an extended body with dozens of different

A jerking shrug. &quot;Maybe your organs got a bit more cooked than

Szpindel grimaced; his idea of a reassuring smile.  &quot;Repairs
ninety-nine point nine percent of the damage, sure.  By the time you
get to the last zero-point-one, you're into diminishing returns.
These're <I>small</I>, commissar.  Chances are your own body'll take

&quot;TMS effects-&quot; Szpindel snapped his fingers-
&quot;they're <I>sticky</I>, eh?  Neurons get kicked into one state,
take a while to come unstuck.  You never got a TAT?  Well-adjusted
boy like you?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Once or twice,&quot; I said.  &quot;Maybe.&quot;</P>

&quot;Same principle.&quot;</P>

&quot;Party line is they fade over time.  Week or two you're back to
normal.  But out here, with <I>that</I> thing...&quot;  He shrugged.
&quot;Too many variables.  Not the least of which is, I assume we'll
keep going <I>back</I> until Sarasti says otherwise.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;But they're basically magnetic effects.&quot;</P>

&quot;Probably.  Although I'm not betting on anything where <I>that</I>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Could something else be causing them?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Something on <I>this</I> ship?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Like what?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I don't know.  Leakage in <I>Theseus</I>' magnetic shielding,
maybe.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Not normally.  Course, we've all got little implanted networks
in our heads, eh?  And you've got a whole hemisphere of prosthetics
up there, who knows what kind of <I>side</I>-<I>effects</I> those
might let you in for.  Why?  <I>Rorschach</I> not a good enough
reason for you?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<I>I saw them before,</I> I might have said.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
And then Szpindel would say <I>Oh, when? Where?</I></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
And maybe I'd reply <I>When I was spying on your private life</I>,

down to the atoms.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;It's probably nothing.   I've just been-jumpy lately.
Thought I saw something weird in the spinal bundle, back before we
landed on <I>Rorschach</I>.  Just for a second, you know, and it
disappeared as soon as I focused on it.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Multijointed arms with a central mass?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;God no.  Just a flicker, really.  If it was anything at all, it
was probably just Amanda's rubber ball floating around up there.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Probably.&quot;  Szpindel seemed almost amused.  &quot;Couldn't
hurt to check for leakage in the shielding, though.  Just in case.
Not like we need something <I>else</I> making us see things, eh?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

&quot;Gang's fine, if a bit disappointed.  Haven't seen the Major.&quot;

&quot;It hit her pretty hard.&quot;</P>

&quot;No worse than the rest of us, really.  She might not even
remember it.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;How-how could she possibly believe she didn't even

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Szpindel shook his head.  &quot;Didn't believe it.  <I>Knew</I> it.
For a fact.&quot;</P>

&quot;But how-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Charge gauge on your car, right?  Sometimes the contacts
corrode.   Readout freezes on empty, so you think it's empty.  What
else you supposed to think?  Not like you can go in and count the
electrons.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

&quot;Brain's got all <I>kinds</I> of gauges.  You can <I>know</I>
you're blind even when you're not; you can <I>know</I> you can see,
even when you're blind.  And yeah, you can <I>know</I> you don't
exist even when you do.  It's a long list, commissar.  Cotard's,

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He hadn't said <I>blindsight</I>.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;What was it like?&quot; I asked.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Like?&quot; Although he knew exactly what I meant.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Did your arm- move by itself?  When it reached for that
battery?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Oh.  Nah.  You're still in control, you just-you get a
feeling, is all.  A <I>sense</I> of where to reach.  One part of the
brain playing charades with another, eh?&quot;  He gestured at the
couch.  &quot;Get off.  Seen enough of your ugly guts for now.  And
send up Bates if you can find where she's hiding.  Probably back at
Fab building a bigger army.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The misgivings glinted off him like sunlight.  &quot;You have a
problem with her,&quot; I said.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He started to deny it, then remembered who he was talking to.  &quot;Not
personally.  Just-human node running mechanical infantry.
Electronic reflexes slaved to meat reflexes. You tell me where the
weak spot is.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Down in <I>Rorschach,</I> I'd have to say <I>all</I> the links
are pretty weak.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Not talking about <I>Rorschach</I>,&quot; Szpindel said.  &quot;We
go there.  What stops them from coming here?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Them.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Maybe they haven't arrived yet,&quot; he admitted.  &quot;But
when they do, I'm betting we'll be going up against something bigger
than anaerobic microbes.&quot;  When I didn't answer he continued,
his voice lowered.  &quot;And anyway, Mission Control didn't know
shit about <I>Rorschach</I>.  They thought they were sending us some
place where drones could do all the heavy lifting.  But they just
hate not being in command, eh?  Can't admit the grunts're smarter
than the generals.  So our defenses get compromised for political
appearances-not like <I>that's</I> any kinda news-and I'm
no jarhead but it strikes me as real bad strategy.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I remembered Amanda Bates, midwifing the birth of her troops.  <I>I'm
more of a safety precaution....</I></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Amanda-&quot; I began.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Yeah, people keep saying that.  Can't trust the machines.
Luddites love to go on about computer malfunctions, and how many
accidental wars we might have prevented because a human had the final
say.  But funny thing, commissar; nobody talks about how many
intentional wars got <I>started</I> for the same reason.  You're
still writing those postcards to posterity?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

Imagine you are a prisoner of war.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
You've got to admit you saw it coming.  You've been crashing tech and
seeding biosols for a solid eighteen months; that's a good run by
anyone's standards. Realist saboteurs do not, as a rule, enjoy long
careers.  Everyone gets caught eventually.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
It wasn't always thus.  There was a day you might have even hoped for
a peaceful retirement.  But then they brought the vampires back from
the Pleistocene and Great Grieving Ganga did <I>that</I> ever turn
the balance of power upside down.  Those fuckers are always ten steps
ahead.  It only makes sense; after all, hunting people is what
bloodsuckers evolved to <I>do</I>.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
There's this line from an early pop-dyn textbook, really old, maybe
even TwenCen. It's something of a mantra-maybe <I>prayer</I>
would be a better word-among those in your profession.
<I>Predators run for their dinner</I>, it goes.  <I>Prey run for
their lives.</I>  The moral is supposed to be that on average, the
hunted escape the hunters because they're more motivated.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Maybe that was true when it all just came down to who ran faster.
Doesn't seem to hold when the strategy involves tactical foresight
and double-reverse mind fucks, though.  The vampires win every time.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
And now you're caught, and while it may have been vampires that set
the trap, it was regular turncoat baseline humans who pulled the
trigger.  For six hours now you've been geckoed to the wall of some
unnamed unlisted underground detention facility, watching as some of
those selfsame <I>humans</I> played games with your boyfriend and
co-conspirator.  These are not your average games.  They involve
pliers, and glowing wires, and body parts that were not designed to
detach.  You wish, by now, that your lover were dead, like the two
others in your cell whose parts are scattered  about the room.  But
they're not letting that happen.  They're having too much fun.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
That's what it all comes down to.  This is not an interrogation;
there are less invasive ways to get more reliable answers.  These are
simply a few more sadistic thugs with Authority, killing time and
other things, and you can only cry and squeeze your eyes tight and
whimper like an animal even though they haven't laid a hand on you
yet.  You can only wish they hadn't saved you for last, because you
know what that means.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
But suddenly your tormentors stop in mid-game and cock their heads as
if listening to some collective inner voice.  Presumably it tells
them to take you off the wall, bring you into the next room, and sit
you down at one of two gel-padded chairs on opposite sides of a smart
desk, because this is what they do-far more gently than you'd
expect-before retiring.  You can also assume that whoever has
given these instructions is both powerful and displeased, because all
the arrogant sadistic cockiness has drained from their faces in the
space of a heartbeat.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
You sit and wait.  The table glows with soft, cryptic symbols that
would be of no earthly interest to you even if you could understand
them, even if they contained the very secret of the vampires
themselves.  Some small part of you wonders if this latest
development might be cause for hope; the rest of you doesn't dare
believe it.  You hate yourself for caring about your own survival
when chunks of your friends and allies are still warm on the other
side of the wall.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
A stocky Amerind woman appears in the room with you, clad in
nondescript military weave.  Her hair is buzzed short, her throat
veined with the faint mesh of a sub-q antennae.  Your brain stem sees
that she is ten meters tall, even though some impertinent gelatinous
overlay insists that she is of only average height.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The name tag on her left breast says <I>Bates</I>.  You see no sign
of rank.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<I>Bates </I>extracts a weapon from its sheath on her thigh.  You
flinch, but she does not point it at you.  She sets it on the desk,
easily within your reach, and sits across from you.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
A microwave pistol.  Fully charged, unlocked.  On its lowest setting
it causes sunburn and nausea.  On its highest it flash-boils brains
in the skull.  At any setting between, it inflicts pain and injury in
increments as fine as your imagination.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Your imagination has been retooled for great sensitivity along such
scales.  You stare numbly at the gun, trying to figure the trick.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Two of your friends are dead,&quot; Bates says, as though you
haven't just watched them die. &quot;Irrecoverably so.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Irrecoverably dead.  Good one.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;We could reconstitute the bodies, but the brain damage...&quot;
 Bates clears her throat as if uncomfortable, as if embarrassed. It's
a surprisingly human gesture for a monster.  &quot;We're trying to
save the other one.  No promises.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;We need information,&quot; she says, cutting to the chase.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Of course.  What came before was psychology, softening-up.  Bates is
the good cop.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I've got nothing to tell you,&quot; you manage.  It's ten
percent defiance, ninety percent deduction: they wouldn't have been
able to catch you in the first place unless they already knew
everything.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Then we need an arrangement,&quot; Bates says.  &quot;We need
to come to some kind of accommodation.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
She has to be kidding.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Your incredulity must be showing.  Bates addresses it:  &quot;I'm not
completely unsympathetic.  My gut doesn't much like the idea of
swapping reality for simulation, and it doesn't buy that
what-is-truth spin the Body Economic sells to get around it.  Maybe
there's reason to be scared.  Not my problem, not my job, just my
opinion and it could be wrong.  But if we kill each other in the
meantime, we don't find out either way.  It's unproductive.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
You see the dismembered bodies of your friends.  You see pieces on
the floor, still a little bit alive, and this cunt has the nerve to
talk about <I>productivity</I>?</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;We didn't start it,&quot; you say.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I don't know and I don't care.  Like I said, it's not my job.&quot;
 Bates jerks a thumb over her shoulder at a door in the wall behind
her, the door she must have entered through.  &quot;In there,&quot;
she says, &quot;are the ones who killed your friends.  They've been
disarmed.  When you go through that door the room will go offline and
remain unmonitored for a period of sixty seconds.  Nobody besides
yourself will ever hold you accountable for whatever happens in there
during that time.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
It's a trick.  It has to be.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;What do you have to lose?&quot; Bates wonders.  &quot;We can
already do anything we want to you.  It's not like we need you to
give us an excuse.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Hesitantly, you take the gun.  Bates doesn't stop you.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
She's right, you realize.  You have absolutely nothing to lose. You
stand and, suddenly fearless, point the weapon at her face.  &quot;Why
go in there?  I can kill you right <I>here</I>.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
She shrugs.  &quot;You could try.  Waste of an opportunity, if you
ask me.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;So I go in there, and I come out in sixty seconds, and then
what?&quot;</P>

Under other circumstances, Lieutenant Amanda Bates would have been
court-martialed and executed within the month.  No matter that the
four who'd died had been guilty of multiple counts of rape, torture,
and homicide; that's just what people <I>did</I> in wartime.  It's
what they'd always done.  There was nothing <I>polite</I> about war,
no honorable code beyond the chain of command and the circling of
wagons.  Deal with indiscretions if you must; punish the guilty if
you have to, for appearance if nothing else.  But for God's sake
close the doors first.  Never give your enemy the satisfaction of
seeing discord in the ranks, show them nothing but unity and
flinty-eyed resolve.  There may be murderers and rapists in our

Still, it was hard to argue with results:  a negotiated ceasefire
with the third-largest Realist franchise in the hemisphere.  An
immediate forty-six percent decline in terrorist activities
throughout the affected territories.  The unconditional cancellation
of several in-progress campaigns which could have seriously
compromised three major catacombs and taken out the Duluth Staging

Sometime during her court-martial, Bates's death sentence turned into
a rehabilitation; the only question was whether it would take place
in the stockade or Officer's College.  As it turned out, Leavenworth

Five times we did it.  Over five consecutive orbits we threw
ourselves between the monster's jaws, let it chew at us with a
trillion microscopic teeth until <I>Theseus</I> reeled us in and
stitched us back together.  We crept through <I>Rorschach</I>'s belly
in fits and starts, focusing as best we could on the tasks at hand,
trying to ignore the ghosts that tickled our midbrains.  Sometimes
the walls flexed subtly around us.  Sometimes we only thought they
did.  Sometimes we took refuge in our diving bell while waves of
charge and magnetism spiraled languidly past, like boluses of
ectoplasm coursing down the intestine of some poltergeist god.</P>

  Sometimes we got caught in the open.  The Gang would squabble
amongst itself, uncertain which persona was which.  Once I fell into
a kind of waking paralysis while alien hands dragged me away down the
hall; fortunately other hands brought me home, and voices that
claimed to be real told me I'd made the whole thing up.  Twice Amanda
Bates found God,  <I>saw</I> the fucker right there in front of her,
knew beyond any shadow of a doubt that the creator not only existed
but <I>spoke</I> to her, and her alone.  Both times she lost her

line-of-sight control, staggered from their perimeters and pointed
their weapons along bearings too close for comfort.</P>

The grunts died fast.  Some barely lasted a single foray; a few died
in minutes.  The longest-lived were the slowest on the draw,
half-blind, thick-witted, every command and response bottlenecked by
raw high-frequency sound buzzing across their shielded eardrums.
Sometimes we backed them up with others that spoke optically:  faster
but nervous, and even more vulnerable.  Together they guarded against
an opposition that had not yet shown its face.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
We worked through it all, through fits and hallucinations and
occasional convulsions.  We tried to watch each others' backs while
magnetic tendrils tugged our inner ears and made us seasick.
Sometimes we vomited into our helmets; then we'd just hang on,
white-faced, sucking sour air through clenched teeth while the
recyclers filtered chunks and blobs from our headspace.  And we'd
give silent thanks for the small mercy of nonstick, static-repellent
faceplates.</P>

It rapidly became obvious that my presence served as more than cannon
fodder.  It didn't matter that I lacked the Gang's linguistic skills
or Szpindel's expertise in biology; I was another set of hands, in a
place where anyone could be laid out at a moment's notice.  The more
people Sarasti kept in the field, the greater the odds that at least
one of them would be halfway functional at any given moment.  Even
so, we were in barely any condition to accomplish anything.  Every
incursion was an exercise in reckless endangerment.

We did it anyway.  It was that or go home.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The work proceeded in infinitesimal increments, hamstrung on every
front.  The Gang wasn't finding any evidence of signage or speech to
decipher, but the gross mechanics of this thing were easy enough to
observe.  Sometimes <I>Rorschach</I> partitioned itself, extruded
ridges around its passageways like the cartilaginous hoops encircling
a human trachea.  Over hours some of them might develop into
contracting irises, into complete septa, lazy as warm candle wax.  We
seemed to be witnessing the growth of the structure in discrete
segments.  <I>Rorschach</I> grew mainly from the tips of its thorns;
we'd made our incursion hundreds of meters from the nearest, but
evidently the process extended at least this far back.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
If it <I>was</I> part of the normal growth process, though, it was a
feeble echo of what must have been going on in the heart of the
apical zones.  We couldn't observe those directly, not from inside;
barely a hundred meters towards the thorn the tube grew too lethal
even for suicidal flesh.  But over those five orbits <I>Rorschach</I>
grew by another eight percent, as mindless and mechanical as a
growing crystal.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Through it all I tried to do my job.  I compiled and collated,
massaged data I would never understand.  I watched the systems around
me as best I could, factored each tic and trait into the mix.  One
part of my mind produced synopses and syntheses while another
watched, incredulous and uncomprehending.  Neither part could trace
where those insights had come from.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
It was difficult, though.  Sarasti wouldn't let me back outside the
system.  Every observation was contaminated by my own confounding
presence in the mix.  I did my best.  I made no suggestions that
might affect critical decisions.  In the field I did what I was told
to, and no more.  I tried to be like one of Bates's drones, a simple
tool with no initiative and no influence on the group dynamic.  I
think I pulled it off, for the most part.</P>

Szpindel was right:  the ghosts followed us back.  We began to hear
voices other than Sarasti's, whispering up the spine.  Sometimes even
the brightly-lit wraparound world of the drum would warp and jiggle
from the corner of my eye-and more than once I saw boney
headless phantoms with too many arms, nested in the scaffolding.
They seemed solid enough from the corner of my eye but any spot I
focused on faded to shadow, to a dark translucent stain against the
background.  They were so very fragile, these ghosts.  The mere act
of observation drilled holes through them.</P>

Szpindel had rattled off dementias like raindrops.  I went to
ConSensus for enlightenment and found a whole other self buried below
the limbic system, below the hindbrain, below even the cerebellum.
It lived in the brain stem and it was older than the vertebrates
themselves.   It was self-contained:  it heard and saw and felt,
independent of all those other parts layered overtop like
evolutionary afterthoughts.  It dwelt on nothing but its own
survival.  It had no time for planning or abstract analysis, spared
effort for only the most rudimentary sensory processing.  But it was
<I>fast</I>, and it was dedicated, and it could react to threats in a
fraction of the time it took its smarter roommates to even become
<I>aware</I> of them.</P>

And even when it couldn't-when the obstinate, unyielding
neocortex refused to let it off the leash-still it tried to
pass on what it saw, and Isaac Szpindel experienced an ineffable
sense of <I>where to reach</I>.  In a way, he had a stripped-down

I looked further and found God Itself in the meat of the brain, found
the static that had sent Bates into rapture and Michelle into
convulsions.  I tracked Gray Syndrome to its headwaters in the
temporal lobe.  I heard voices ranting in the brains of
schizophrenics.  I found cortical infarcts that inspired people to
reject their own limbs, imagined the magnetic fields that must have
acted in their stead when Cruncher tried to dismember himself.    And
off in some half-forgotten pesthole of Twentieth-century case
studies-filed under <I>Cotard's Syndrome</I>-I found
Amanda Bates and others of her kind, their brains torqued into denial
of the very self.  &quot;I used to have a heart,&quot; one of them
said listlessly from the archives.  &quot;Now I have something that
beats in its place.&quot;  Another demanded to be buried, because his
corpse was already stinking.</P>

There was more, a whole catalog of finely-tuned dysfunctions that
<I>Rorschach</I> had not yet inflicted on us.  Somnambulism.
Agnosias.   Hemineglect.   ConSensus served up a freak show to make
any mind reel at its own fragility:  a woman dying of thirst within
easy reach of water, not because she couldn't see the faucet but
because she couldn't <I>recognize </I>it.  A man for whom the left
side of the universe did not exist, who could neither perceive nor

text.  A man for whom the very concept of <I>leftness</I> had become

Sometimes we could conceive of things and still not see them,
although they stood right before us.  Skyscrapers appeared out of
thin air, the person talking to us changed into someone else during a
momentary distraction- and we didn't notice.  It wasn't magic.
It was barely even misdirection.  They called it <I>inattentional

tendency for the eye to simply <I>not notice</I> things that

burned away, any possibility of vision denied by the laws of physics:
 bumping into walls, tripping over furniture, inventing endless
ludicrous explanations for their clumsiness.  The lights,

Gauges in the head, Szpindel had called them.  But there were other
things in there too.  There was a model of the world, and we didn't
look <I>outward</I> at all; our conscious selves saw only the
simulation in our heads, an <I>interpretation</I> of reality,
endlessly refreshed by input from the senses.  What happens when

Around me, the light died; inside me, a swarm of floaters mixed it up
with the chronic half-visions <I>Rorschach</I> had already planted in
my head.  Alarms chirped irritatingly in my helmet-  <I>breach,
breach, breach</I>-until the smart fabric of the suit softened
and congealed where the holes had been.  Something stung maddeningly
in my left side.  I felt as if I'd been branded.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Keeton!  Check Szpindel!&quot;  Bates had called off the
lasers.  The grunts closed for hand-to-hand, reaching with fiery
nozzles and diamond-tipped claws to grapple with some prismatic
material glowing softly <I>behind</I> that burnt-back skin.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<I>Fibrous reflector</I>, I realized.  It had shattered the laser
light, turned it to luminous shrapnel and thrown it back in our
faces.  Clever.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
But its surface was still alight, even with the lasers down; a
diffuse glow, dipping and weaving, filtered through from the far side
of the barrier while the drones chewed doggedly through the near one.
 After a moment it struck me:  James's headlamp.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;<I>Keeton!</I>&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Right.  Szpindel.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
His faceplate was intact.  The laser had melted the Faraday mesh
laminated onto the crystal, but the suit was sealing that tiny hole
even now.  The hole behind, drilled neatly through his forehead,
remained.  The eyes beneath stared at infinity.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Well?&quot; Bates asked.  She could read his vitals as easily
as I, but <I>Theseus</I> was capable of post-mortem rebuilds.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Barring brain damage.  &quot;No.&quot;</P>

The whine of drills and shredders stopped; the ambience brightened.
I looked away from Szpindel's remains.  The grunts had cut a hole in
the septum's fibrous underlayer.  One of them nosed its way through
to the other side.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
A new sound rose into the mix, a soft animal keening, haunted and
dissonant.  For a moment I thought <I>Rorschach</I> was whispering to
us again;  its walls seemed to contract slightly around me.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;James?&quot; Bates snapped.  &quot;<I>James!</I>&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Not James.  A little girl in a woman's body in an armored spacesuit,
scared out of her wits.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The grunt nudged her curled-up body back into our company.  Bates
took it gently.  &quot;Susan?  Come back, Suze.  You're safe.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The grunts hovered restlessly, alert in every direction, pretending
everything was under control.  Bates spared me a glance-&quot;Take
Isaac.&quot;-and turned back to James. &quot;Susan?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;N-n-no,&quot; whimpered a small voice, a little girl's
voice.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Michelle?  Is that you?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;There was a <I>thing</I>,&quot; the little girl said. &quot;It
<I>grabbed</I> me.  It grabbed my <I>leg</I>.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;We're out of here.&quot; Bates pulled the Gang back along the
passage.  One grunt lingered, watching the hole; the other took
point.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;It's gone,&quot; Bates said gently.  &quot;There's nothing
there now.  See the feed?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;You can't <I>s</I>-see it.&quot; Michelle whispered.  &quot;It's

The septum receded around a curve as we retreated.  The hole torn
through its center watched us like the ragged pupil of some great
unblinking eye.  It stayed empty as long as it stayed in sight.
Nothing came out after us.  Nothing we could see.  A thought began
cycling through my head, some half-assed eulogy stolen from an
eavesdropped confessional, and try as I might I couldn't shut it
down.

We stripped wordlessly in the decon balloon.  Bates, first out of her
suit, reached for Szpindel but the Gang stopped her with a hand and a
headshake.  Personae segued one into another as they stripped the
body.  Susan  removed helmet and backpack and breastplate.  Cruncher
peeled away the silvery leaded skin from collar to toe.  Sascha
stripped the jumpsuit and left the pale flesh naked and exposed.
Except for the gloves.  They left his feedback gloves in place; their
fingertips forever tactile, the flesh inside forever numb.  Through
it all, Szpindel stared unblinking beneath the hole in his forehead.
His glazed eyes focused on distant quasars.</P>

Sarasti hadn't wasted any time.  Szpindel's replacement met us as we
emerged, freshly thawed, nicotine-scented.  The rehydration of his
flesh was ongoing- saline bladders clung to each thigh-although
it would never entirely erase the sharpness of his features.  His
bones cracked when he moved.</P>

The gang turned away.</P>

&quot;We're hot,&quot; Bates said.  Even cut short, the excursion had
piled up a lethal Seivert count.  Faint nausea tickled the back of my
throat.</P>

&quot;Decontaminate later.&quot; One long pull of a zipper and
Szpindel was gone, engulfed in an oily gray shroud.  &quot;You-&quot;
he turned in my direction, pointed at the scorched holes in my
jumpsuit.   &quot;With me.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Robert Cunningham.  Another prototype.  Dark-haired, hollow-cheeked,
a jaw you could use as a ruler.  Both smoother and harsher than the
man he had replaced.  Where Szpindel had ticced and jerked as if
static-charged, Cunningham's face held all the expression of a wax
dummy's.  The wetware that ran those muscles had been press-ganged
into other pursuits.  Even the tremors that afflicted the rest of his
body were muted, soothed by the nicotine he drew with every second
breath.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He held no cigarette now.  He held only the shrouded body of his
hard-luck primary and his ongoing, freshly thawed distaste for the
ship's synthesist.  His fingers trembled.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Bates and the Gang moved silently up the spine.  Cunningham and I
followed, guiding the Shroud of Szpindel between us.  My leg and side
were stinging again, now that Cunningham had reminded them to.  There
wouldn't be much he could do about them, though.  The beams would
have cauterized the flesh on their way through, and if they'd hit
anything vital I'd have been dead already.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
At the hatch we broke into single-file:  Szpindel first, Cunningham
pushing at his heels.  By the time I emerged into the drum Bates and
the gang were already down on deck and taking their usual seats.
Sarasti, in the flesh, watched them from the end of the conference
table.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
His eyes were naked.  From this angle the soft, full-spectrum light
of the drum washed the shine from them.  If you didn't look too
closely, for too long, you might almost think those eyes were Human.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
BioMed had been spun down for my arrival.  Cunningham pointed to a
diagnostic couch on a section of the stilled deck that served as our
infirmary; I floated over and strapped myself in.  Two meters away,
past a waist-high guard rail that had risen from the deck, the rest
of the drum rolled smoothly past.  It slung Bates and the Gang and
Sarasti around like weights on a string.

I tapped ConSensus to hear them.  James was speaking, quietly and
without expression.  &quot;I noticed a new pattern in the
form-constants.  Something in the grating.  It looked like a signal.
It got stronger as I went down the tunnel, I followed it, I blacked
out.  I don't remember anything more until we were on our way back.
Michelle filled me in, as much as she could.  That's all I know.  I'm
sorry.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
A hundred degrees away in the no-gee zone, Cunningham maneuvered his
predecessor into a coffin with different options than those up front.
 I wondered if it would embark on an autopsy during the debriefing.
I wondered if we'd be able to hear the sounds it made.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Sascha,&quot; Sarasti said.</P>

&quot;Yeah.&quot;  Sascha's trademark drawl infected the voice.  &quot;I
was riding Mom.  Went deaf dumb and stark fucking blind when she
passed out.  I tried to take over but something was blocking me.
Michelle, I guess.  Never thought she had it in her.  I couldn't even
<I>see</I>.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

notice anything else.&quot;</P>

Cunningham was back at my side.  The inevitable cigarette had

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Nothing touches you,&quot; the vampire surmised.  &quot;Nothing

&quot;No,&quot;  Sascha said.  She didn't believe Michelle's stories

could so easily explain anything we experienced?</P>

&quot;Cruncher.&quot;</P>

&quot;Don't know anything,&quot;  I still wasn't used to the maleness
of the voice now emanating from James's throat.  Cruncher was a
workaholic.  He hardly ever surfaced in mixed company.

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;You're there,&quot; Sarasti reminded him.  &quot;You must

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Mom sent me patterns to parse.  I was working on them.  I'm
<I>still</I> working on them,&quot; he added pointedly.  &quot;I
didn't notice anything.  Is that all?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
 I'd never been able to get a good read on him.  Sometimes Cruncher
seemed to have more in common with the dozens of nonconscious modules
working in James's head than with sentient hubs comprising the rest
of the Gang.  &quot;You feel nothing?&quot;  Sarasti pressed.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

Cunningham stabbed at my wounds with anabolisers, muttering to
himself.  Faint blue smoke curled between us.  &quot;Isaac found some

&quot;No.  There's brain damage.&quot;  There was something like
sympathy in the vampire's voice, the practiced affectation of an
accomplished mimic.  There was something else, too, an
all-but-imperceptible hunger, a subtle edge of <I>temptation</I>.  I
don't think anyone heard it but me.</P>

Michelle had fallen silent again.  When she continued, her voice only
faltered a little:  &quot;I can't tell you much.  It grabbed me.  It

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

&quot;Yes,&quot; Sarasti said.  Michelle sank below the surface as

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Trust Michelle's,&quot; Sarasti said.  He opened a window as I
grew heavier:  a grunt's-eye view of a fuzzy, bright blob weaving
behind the translucent waxed-paper fibers of the skinned septum.
James's headlight, from the wrong side of the barrier.  The image
wobbled a bit as the drone staggered through some local pocket of
magnetism, then replayed.  Wobbled, replayed.  A six-second loop.</P>

&quot;See something next to the Gang.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Non-vampires saw no such thing.  Sarasti froze the image, evidently
realizing as much.  &quot;Diffraction patterns aren't consistent with
a single light source in open space.  I see dimmer elements,
reflective elements.  Two dark objects close together, similar size,
scattering light  here-&quot; a cursor appeared at two utterly
nondescript points on the image- &quot;and here.  One's the
Gang.  The other's unaccounted for.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Just a minute,&quot; Cunningham said.  &quot;If <I>you</I> can
see it through all that, why didn't Su-why didn't <I>Michelle</I>
see anything?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

BioMed jerked slightly, locking  into spin-synch with the drum; the
guard rail sank back into the deck.  Off in some far-off corner,
something without eyes watched me watching it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

Some of the simpler tics make it through:  Sascha's good-natured
belligerence, Sarasti's aversion to the past tense.  Cunningham lost
most of his gender pronouns to an unforeseen glitch during the work
on his temporal lobe.  But it went beyond that.  The whole lot of
them threw English and Hindi and Hadzane into every second sentence;
no real scientist would allow their thoughts to be hamstrung by the
conceptual limitations of a single language.  Other times they acted
almost as synthesists in their own right, conversing in grunts and
gestures that would be meaningless to any baseline.  It's not so much
that the bleeding edge lacks social skills; it's just that once you
get past a certain point, formal speech is too damn <I>slow</I>.

devoted to Communication As Unifier that she'd cut her own brain into
disunified chunks to make the point.  She was the only one who ever
seemed to care who she was talking to.  The others spoke only for
themselves, even when they spoke to each other.  Even James's other

Fifteen minutes to apogee:  maximum safe distance, in case <I>Rorschach</I>
decided to hit back.  Far below,  the artefact's magnetic field

In a way, this was her fault.  If she had just treated this new
travail as one more cross to bear, perhaps things would have gone on
more or less as before.  There would have been some faint hope that
Sarasti would have let us grit our teeth and keep on going, besieged
now by spring-loaded trapdoors as well as the usual gauntlet of
Seiverts and magnets and monsters from the id.  But Bates had made an

On previous expeditions we'd charted twenty-six septa in various
stages of development.  We'd x-rayed them.  We'd done ultrasound.
We'd watched them ooze their way across passages or ebb slowly back
into the walls.  The iris that had snapped shut behind the Gang of
Four had been a whole different animal.</P>

It had always been breaking and entering, of course.  That much
hadn't changed.  But when we'd jimmied the lock we'd thought we were
vandalizing an empty summer cottage, still under construction.  We'd
thought the owners would be out of the picture for a while.  We
hadn't been expecting one of them to catch us on his way to take a
late-night piss.  And now that one had, and vanished into the
labyrinth, it was natural to wonder what weapons it might keep
stashed under the pillow-</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<I>Those septa could spring on us any time.  How many are there?  Are

with her.</P>

Twelve minutes to apogee.  From this high ground, well above the
static, <I>Theseus</I> peered down through <I>Rorschach</I>'s
wrenched and twisted anatomy to keep rock-steady eyes on the tiny
wound we'd burned in its side.  Our limpet tent covered it like a

unfolding experiment.</P>

Eleven minutes to apogee, and Amanda Bates was lamenting the fact-not
for the first time- that this mission was not under military
jurisdiction.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
We were waiting for maximum distance before performing the
experiment.  <I>Rorschach might interpret this as a hostile act</I>,
Sarasti had conceded in a voice that contained no trace of irony
whatsoever.  Now he stood before us, watching ConSensus play on the
table.  Reflections writhed across his naked eyes, not quite masking
the deeper reflections behind them.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Ten minutes to apogee.  Susan James was wishing that Cunningham would
put out that goddamned cigarrette.  The smoke stank on its way to the
ventilators, and anyway, it wasn't <I>necessary.</I> It was just an
anachronistic affectation, an attention-getting device; if he needed
the nicotine a patch could have soothed his tremors just as easily,
without the smoke and the stink.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
That wasn't all she was thinking, though.  She was wondering why
Cunningham had been summoned to Sarasti's quarters earlier in the
shift, why he'd looked at her so strangely afterward.  I wondered
about that myself.  A quick check on ConSensus timestamps showed that
her medical file had been accessed during that period.  I checked
those stats, let the shapes bounce between hemispheres: part of my
brain locked on <I>elevated oxytocin</I> as the probable reason for
that conference.  There was an eighty-two percent chance that James
had become too <I>trusting</I> for Sarasti's liking.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

Barely a molecule of <I>Rorschach</I>'s atmosphere had been lost on
our account.  That was all about to change.  Our view of  base camp
split like a dividing bacterium:  one window now focused on the
limpet tent, the other on a wide-angle tactical enhance of the space
around it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

Down on <I>Rorschach</I>, our tent burst like a bug beneath a boot.
A geyser erupted from the wound; a snowstorm swirled at its edges,
its charged curlicues intricate as lace.  Atmosphere gushed into
vacuum, spread thin, crystallized.  Briefly, the space around base
camp <I>sparkled</I>.  It was almost beautiful.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Bates didn't think it was beautiful at all.  She watched that
bleeding wound with a face as expressionless as Cunningham's, but her
jaw was clenched unto tetanus.  Her eyes darted between views:
watching for things gasping in the shadows.

Vast trunks and arteries shuddered, a seismic tremor radiating out
along the structure.  The epicenter began to <I>twist</I>, a vast
segment rotating on its axis, the breach midway along its length.
Stress lines appeared where the length that rotated sheared against
the lengths to either side that didn't; the structure seemed to
soften and stretch there, constricting like a great elongate balloon
torqueing itself into sausage links.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

ConSensus groaned with the sound of worlds scraping against each
other: telemetry from the onsite sensors, their ears to the ground.
Jack's camera controls had frozen again.  The image it sent was
canted and grainy.    The pickup stared blankly at the edge of the
hole we'd bored into the underworld.

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

Sudden motion at base camp.  At first I thought it was static on
Jack's feed, playing along lines of high contrast-but no,
something was definitely moving along the edges of the hole we'd
burned.  Something almost <I>wriggled</I> there, a thousand gray
mycelia extruding from the cut surface and writhing slowly into the
darkness.  &quot;It's-huh,&quot; Bates said.  &quot;Triggered
by the pressure drop, I guess.  That's one way to seal a breach.&quot;</P>

First-person sex-<I>real</I> sex, as Chelsea insisted on
calling it-was an acquired taste:  jagged breathing, the raw
slap and stink of sweaty skin full of pores and blemishes, a whole
other person with a whole other set of demands and dislikes.  There
was definite animal appeal, no doubt about it.  This was, after all,
how we'd done it for millions of years.  But this, this third-world
carnality had always carried an element of struggle, of asynchronous
patterns in conflict.  There was no convergence here.  There was only
the rhythm of bodies in collision, a struggle for dominance, each
trying to force the other into synch.

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Chelsea regarded it as love in its purest form.  I came to think of
it as hand-to-hand combat.  Before, whether fucking creations from my

selected the contrast and the rez, the texture and the attitude.  The
bodily functions, the resistance of competing desires, the endless

It was hers too, for that matter.  Nobody who spliced brains for a

I could have pointed that out too, I suppose, but I knew how much

destruction.  I didn't want to lose her.  I didn't want to lose that

lived or died.  I only wanted her to back off a bit.   I only wanted
room to breathe.</P>

time we came in like a strike force.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<I>Scylla</I> burned towards <I>Rorschach</I> at over two gees, its
trajectory a smooth and predictable arc ending at the ruptured base
camp.  It may have even landed there, for all I know; perhaps Sarasti
had two-birded the mission, programmed the shuttle for some
collecting of its own.  If so, it wouldn't land with us on board.
<I>Scylla</I> spat us into space almost fifty kilometers short of the
new beachhead, left us naked and plummeting on some wireframe
contraption with barely enough reaction mass for a soft landing and a
quick getaway.  We didn't even have control over <I>that</I>:
success depended on unpredictability, and how better to ensure that
than to not even know ourselves what we were doing?</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Sarasti's logic. Vampire logic.  We could follow it partway:  the
colossal deformation that had sealed <I>Rorschach</I>'s breach was so
much slower, so much more expensive than the dropgate that had
trapped the Gang.  The fact that dropgates <I>hadn't</I> been used
implied that they took time to deploy-to redistribute necessary
mass, perhaps, or spring-load its reflexes.  That gave us a window.
We could still venture into the den so long as the lions couldn't
predict our destination and set traps in advance.  So long as we got
out again before they could set them afterwards.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Thirty-seven minutes,&quot; Sarasti had said, and none of us
could fathom how he'd come to that number.  Only Bates had dared to
ask aloud, and he had merely glinted at her:  &quot;You can't
follow.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Vampire logic.  From an obvious premise to an opaque conclusion.  Our
lives depended on it.</P>

The retros followed some preprogrammed algorithm that mated Newton
with a roll of the dice.  Our vector wasn't completely random-once
we'd eliminated raceways and growth zones, areas without
line-of-sight escape routes,  dead ends and unbranched segments
(&quot;Boring,&quot; Sarasti said, dismissing them), barely ten
percent of the artefact remained in the running.  Now we dropped
towards a warren of brambles eight kilometers from our original
landing site.  Here in the midst of our final approach, there was no
way that even <I>we</I> could predict our precise point of impact.</P>

We fell.  Ridged spires and gnarled limbs sectioned the sky wherever
I looked, cut the distant starscape and the imminent superJovian into
a jagged mosaic veined in black.  Three kilometers away or thirty,
the tip of some swollen extremity burst in a silent explosion of
charged particles, a distant fog of ruptured, freezing atmosphere.
Even as it faded I could make out wisps and streamers swirling into
complex spirals:  <I>Rorschach</I>'s magnetic field, sculpting the
artefact's very breath into radioactive sleet.</P>

The sled fired its brakes.  I snapped back against the webbing of my
harness, bumped against the rebounding armored body next to me.
Sascha.  <I>Only Sascha</I>, I remembered.  Cunningham had sedated
the rest of them, left this one core lonely and alone in the group
body.  I hadn't even realized that that was possible with multiple
personalities.  She stared back at me from behind her faceplate.
None of her surfaces showed through the suit.  I could see nothing in
her eyes.</P>

Cunningham was not with us.  Nobody had asked why, when Sarasti
assigned the berths.  The biologist was first among equals now, a
backup restored with no other behind him.  The second-least
replaceable of our irreplaceable crew.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

A silent bump shuddered up the frame.  I looked forward again, past
Bates on the front pallet, past the anchored drones that flanked her
two to each side.  The sled had launched its assault, a prefab
inflatable vestibule mounted on an explosive injection assembly that
would punch through <I>Rorschach</I>'s skin like a virus penetrating
a host cell.  The spindle-legged contraption dwindled and disappeared
from my sight.  Moments later a pinpoint sodium sun flared and died
against the ebony landscape ahead-antimatter charge, so small
you could almost count the atoms, shot directly into the hull.  A lot
rougher than the tentative foreplay of our first date.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
We landed, hard, while the vestibule was still inflating.  The grunts
were off the sled an instant before contact, spitting tiny puffs of
gas from their nozzles, arranging themselves around us in a
protective rosette.  Bates was up next, leaping free of her
restraints and sailing directly towards the swelling hab.  Sascha and
I unloaded the fiberop hub-a clamshell drum half a meter thick
and three times as wide-lugging it between us while one of the
grunts slipped through the vestibule's membranous airlock.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Let's move, people.&quot;  Bates was hanging off one of the
inflatable's handholds.  &quot;Thirty minutes to-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
She fell silent.  I didn't have to ask why:  the advance grunt had
positioned itself over the newly-blasted entrance and sent back its
first postcard.</P>

You'd think that would have made it easier.  Our kind has always
feared the dark; for millions of years we huddled in caves and
burrows while unseen things snuffled and growled-or just
<I>waited</I>, silent and undetectable-in the night beyond.

We followed the grunt down into a dim soupy glow like blood-curdled
milk.  At first it seemed as though the atmosphere itself was alight,
a luminous fog that obscured anything more than ten meters distant.
An illusion, as it turned out; the tunnel we emerged into was about
three meters wide and lit by rows of raised  glowing dashes-the
size and approximate shape of dismembered human fingers-wound
in a loose triple helix around the walls.  We'd recorded similar
ridges at the first site, although the breaks had not been so
pronounced and the ridges had been anything but luminous.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Stronger in the near-infrared,&quot; Bates reported, flashing
the spectrum to our HUDs.  The air would have been transparent to pit
vipers.  It <I>was</I> transparent to sonar:  the lead grunt sprayed
the fog with click trains and discovered that the tunnel widened into
some kind of chamber seventeen meters further along.  Squinting in
that direction I could just make out subterranean outlines through
the mist.  I could just make out jawed things, pulling back out of
sight.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Let's go,&quot; Bates said.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
We plugged in the grunts, left one guarding the way out.  Each of us
took another as a guardian angel on point.  The machines spoke to our
HUDs via laser link; they spoke to each other along stiffened lengths
of shielded fiberop that unspooled from the hub trailing in our wake.
 It was the best available compromise in an environment without any
optima.  Our tethered bodyguards would keep us all in touch during
lone excursions around corners or down dead ends.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Yeah.  <I>Lone</I> excursions.  Forced to either split the group or
cover less ground, we were to split the group.  We were
speed-cartographers panning for gold.  Everything we did here was an
act of faith:  faith that the unifying principles of <I>Rorschach</I>'s
internal architecture could be derived from the raw dimensions we'd
grab on the run.  Faith that <I>Rorschach</I>'s internal architecture
even <I>had</I> unifying principles.  Earlier generations had
worshipped malign and capricious spirits.  Ours put its faith in an
ordered universe.  Here in the Devil's Baklava, it was easy to wonder
if our ancestors hadn't been closer to the mark.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
We moved along the tunnel.  Our destination resolved to merely human
eyes:  not so much chamber as <I>nexus</I>, a knot of space formed by
the convergence of a dozen tunnels angling in from different
orientations.  Ragged meshes of quicksilver dots gleamed along
several glistening surfaces; shiny protrusions poked through the
substrate like a scattershot blast of ball-bearings pressed into wet
clay.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Bates shrugged.  Her drones panned the throats around us, spraying
sonar down each.  My HUD sketched a patchy three-d model from the
echoes:  swathes of paint thrown against invisible walls.  We were
dots near the center of a ganglion,  a tiny swarm of parasites
infesting some great hollowed host.  Each tunnel curved away in a
gradual spiral, each along a different orientation.  Sonar could peep
around those bends a few meters further than we could.  Neither eyes
nor ultrasonics saw anything to distinguish one choice from another.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

down her own unbeaten path.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I turned and jetted slowly down my assigned passageway.  The passage
curved clockwise, a long unremarkable spiral; after twenty meters
that curvature would have blocked any view of its entrance even if
the foggy atmosphere hadn't.  My drone kept point across the tunnel,
its sonar clicking like the chattering of a thousand tiny teeth, its
tether unspooling back to the distant drum in the nexus.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
It was a comfort, that leash.  It was <I>short</I>.  The grunts could
stray ninety meters and no further, and we were under strict orders
to stay under their wings at all times.  This dim infested burrow
might lead all the way to hell, but I would not be expected to follow
it nearly so far.  My cowardice had official sanction.</P>

Fifty meters to go.  Fifty meters and I could turn and run with my
tail between my legs.  In the meantime all I had to do was grit my
teeth, and focus, and record:  <I>everything you see</I>, Sarasti had
said. <I> As much as possible of what you can't</I>.  And hope that
this new reduced time limit would expire before <I>Rorschach</I>

I tried to ignore it.  I tried to look away.  But this phantom wasn't
flickering at the edge of vision; it hovered near the center of my
faceplate, floating like a spot of swirling dizziness between me and
the HUD.  I gritted my teeth and tried to look past, stared into the
dim bloody haze of the middle distance, watched the jerky unfolding
travelogues in the little windows labeled <I>Bates</I> and <I>James</I>.
 Nothing out there.  But in <I>here</I>, floating before my eyes,

Not just Bates' window, either.  Sascha's inset and the drone's-eye
sonarscape flickered and died at the same moment, stripped my HUD
bare except for in-suit feeds and a little red readout flashing Link
Down.  I spun but the grunt was still there, three meters off my
right shoulder.  Its optical port was clearly visible, a ruby
thumbnail set into the plastron.</P>

The grunt skidded sideways, as if slapped by a giant hand.  It
bounced off the wall and suddenly the laser link was back, filling
the HUD with intelligence:  first-person perspectives of Bates and
Sascha racing along alien tunnels, a grunt's-eye view of a space suit
with <I>Keeton</I> stenciled across its breastplate and there, right
beside it, some <I>thing</I> like a rippling starfish with too many
arms-</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The Gang barreled around the curve and now I almost <I>could</I> see
something with my own eyes, flickering like heat-lightning off to one
side.  It was large, and it was moving, but somehow my eyes just <I>slid
off</I> every time they tried to get a fix.  <I>It's not real</I>, I
thought, giddy with hysterical relief, <I>it's just another
hallucination</I> but then Bates sailed into view and it was <I>right
there</I>, no flickering, no uncertainty, nothing but a collapsed
probability wave and solid, undeniable mass.  Exposed, it grabbed the
nearest wall and scrambled over our heads, segmented arms flailing
like whips.  A sudden crackling buzz in the back of my head and it
was drifting free again, charred and smoking.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
A stuttering click.  The whine of machinery gearing down.  Three
grunts hovered in formation in the middle of the passageway.  One
faced the alien.  I glimpsed the tip of some lethal proboscis sliding
back into its sheath.  Bates shut the grunt down before it had
finished closing its mouth.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

The offlined grunt drifted in the murky air.  The alien carcass
bumped gently off the wall, twitching: a hydra of human backbones,
scorched and fleshless.  It didn't look much like my on-board visions
after all.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
For some reason I couldn't put my finger on, I found that almost
reassuring.</P>

The two active grunts panned the fog until Bates gave them new
orders; then one turned to secure the carcass, the other to steady
its fallen comrade.  Bates grabbed the dead grunt and unplugged its
tether.  &quot;Fall back.  Slowly.  I'm right behind you.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I tweaked my jets.  Sascha hesitated.  Coils of shielded cable

&quot;<I>Now</I>,&quot; Bates said, plugging a feed from her own suit
directly into the offlined grunt.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Sascha started after me.  Bates took up the rear.  I watched my HUD;
a swarm of multiarmed monsters would appear there any moment.</P>

They didn't.  But the blackened thing against the belly of Bates'
machine was real enough.  Not a hallucination.  Not even some
understandable artefact of fear and synesthesia.  <I>Rorschach</I>
was inhabited.  Its inhabitants were invisible.

Bates threw the deactivated grunt into the sky as soon as we'd made
vacuum.  Its comrades used it for target practice while we strapped
in, firing and firing until there was nothing left but cooling vapor.
 <I>Rorschach</I> spun even that faint plasma into filigree before it
faded.</P>

She called ahead.  By the time we made it back Cunningham had grown
another little tumor on <I>Theseus</I>' spine, a remote surgery
packed with teleops and sensors.  One of the surviving grunts grabbed
the carcass and jumped ship as soon as we passed beneath the
carapace, completing the delivery as we docked.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
We were born again to the fruits of a preliminary necropsy.  The
holographic ghost of the dissected alien rose from ConSensus like
some flayed and horrific feast.  Its splayed arms looked like human
spinal columns.  We sat around the table and waited for someone else
to take the first bite.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Did you have to shoot it with <I>microwaves</I>?&quot;
Cunningham sniped, tapping the table.  &quot;You completely <I>cooked</I>
the animal.  Every cell was blown out from the inside.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He gave her a sour look.  &quot;A malfunction that just happens to
involve precise targeting of a moving object.  It doesn't sound
random to me.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Bates looked back evenly.  &quot;Something flipped autonomous

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Random is-&quot;</P>

&quot;Give it a rest, Cunningham.  I don't need this shit from you
right now.&quot;</P>

His eyes rolled in that smooth dead face, focused suddenly on
something overhead.  I followed his gaze:  Sarasti stared down at us
like an owl panning for meadow voles,  drifting slowly in the
Coriolis breeze.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
No visor this time, either.  I knew he hadn't lost it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He fixed Cunningham.  &quot;Your findings.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Cunningham swallowed.  Bits and pieces of alien anatomy flickered
with color-coded highlights as he tapped his fingers. &quot;Right,
then.  I'm afraid I can't give you much at the cellular level.
There's not much left inside the membranes.  Not many membranes left,
for that matter.  In terms of gross morphology, the specimen's
dorsoventrally compressed and radially symmetrical, as you can see.
Calcareous exoskeleton, keratinised plastic cuticle.  Nothing
special.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Bates looked skeptical.  &quot;<I>Plastic skin</I> is 'nothing
special'?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Given the environment I was half-expecting a Sanduloviciu
plasma.  Plastic's simply refined petroleum.  Organocarbon.  This
thing is carbon-based.  It's even <I>protein</I> based, although its
proteins are a great deal tougher than ours.  Numerous sulphur
cross-bonds for lateral bracing, as far as I could tell from what
your grunts didn't denature.&quot;  Cunningham's eyes looked past us
all; his consciousness was obviously far aft, haunting remote
sensors.  &quot;The thing's tissues are saturated with magnetite.  On
earth you find that material in dolphin brains, migratory birds, even
some bacteria-anything that navigates or orients using magnetic
fields.  Moving up to macrostructures we've got a pneumatic internal
skeleton, which as far as I can tell doubles as musculature.
Contractile tissue squeezes gas through a system of bladders that
stiffen or relax each segment in the arms.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The light came back into Cunningham's eyes long enough to focus on
his cigarette.  He brought it to his mouth, dragged deeply, set it
down again.  &quot;Note the invaginations around the base of each
arm.&quot;  Flaccid balloons glowed orange on the virtual carcass.
&quot;<I>Cloacae</I>, you could call them.  Everything opens into
them: they eat, breathe, and defecate through the same little
compartment.  No other major orifices.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The Gang made a face that said <I>Sascha, grossed out</I>.  &quot;Don't
things get-clogged up? Seems inefficient.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;If one gets plugged, there's eight other doors into the same
system.  You'll wish you were so <I>inefficient</I> the next time you
choke on a chicken bone.&quot;
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;What <I>does</I> it eat?&quot; Bates asked.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I couldn't say.  I found gizzard-like contractiles around the
cloacae, which implies they <I>chew</I> on something, or did at some
point in their history.  Other than that...&quot;  He spread his
hands; the cigarette left faint streamers in its wake.  &quot;Inflate
those contractiles enough and you create an airtight seal, by the
way.  In conjunction with the cuticle, that would allow this organism
to survive briefly in vacuum.  And we already know it can handle the
ambient radiation, although don't ask me how.  Whatever it uses for
genes must be a great deal tougher than ours.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;So it can survive in space,&quot; Bates mused.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;In the sense that a dolphin survives underwater.  Limited time
only.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;How long?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I'm not certain.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Central nervous system,&quot; Sarasti said.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Bates and the Gang grew suddenly, subtly still.  James's affect
seeped out over her body, supplanting Sascha's.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Smoke curled from Cunningham's mouth and nose.  &quot;There's nothing
<I>central</I> about it, as it transpires.  No cephalisation, not
even clustered sense organs.  The body's covered with something like
eyespots, or chromatophores, or both.  There are setae everywhere.
And as far as I can tell-if all those little cooked filaments
I've been able to put back together after your <I>malfunction</I>
really are nerves and not something completely different-every
one of those structures is under independent control.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Bates sat up straight.  &quot;Seriously?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He nodded.  &quot;It would be akin to independently controlling the
movement of each individual hair on your head, although this creature
is <I>covered</I> with little hairs from tip to tip.  The same thing
applies to the eyes.  Hundreds of thousands of eyes, all over the
cuticle.  Each one is barely more than a pinhole camera, but each is
capable of independent focus and I'm guessing all the different
inputs integrate somewhere up the line.  The entire body acts like a
single diffuse retina.  In theory that gives it enormous visual
acuity.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;A distributed telescope array,&quot; Bates murmured.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;A chromatophore underlies each eye-the pigment's some
kind of cryptochrome so it's probably involved in vision, but it can
also diffuse or contract through the local tissue.  That implies
dynamic pigment patterns, like a squid or a chameleon.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Background pattern-matching?&quot; Bates asked.  &quot;Would
that explain why Siri couldn't see it?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Cunningham opened a new window and played grainy looped imagery of
Siri Keeton and his unseen dance partner.  The creature I hadn't
noticed was ominously solid to the cameras:   a floating discoid
twice as wide as my own torso, arms extending from its edges like
thick knotted ropes.  Patterns rippled across its surface in waves;
sunlight and shadow playing on a shallow seabed.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;As you can see, the background doesn't match the pattern,&quot;
Cunningham said.  &quot;It's not even close.&quot;
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Can you explain Siri's blindness to it?&quot; Sarasti said.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I can't,&quot; Cunningham admitted.  &quot;It's beyond ordinary
crypsis.  But <I>Rorschach</I> makes you see all sorts of things that
aren't there.  Not seeing something that <I>is</I> there might come
down to essentially the same thing.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Another hallucination?&quot; I asked.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Another shrug while Cunningham sucked smoke.  &quot;There are many
ways to fool the human visual system.  It's interesting that the

&quot;But-&quot; James took a breath, bracing herself-
&quot;We're talking about something... sophisticated, at least.
Something very complex.  A great deal of processing power.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Cunningham nodded again.  &quot;I'd estimate nervous tissue accounts
for about thirty percent of body mass.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;So it's intelligent.&quot;  Her voice was almost a whisper.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;But-thirty percent-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Thirty percent <I>motor and sensory</I> wiring.&quot; Another
drag.  &quot;Much like an octopus; an enormous number of neurons, but
half of them get used up running the suckers.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;My understanding is that octopi are quite intelligent,&quot;
James said.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;By molluscan standards, certainly.  But do you have any <I>idea</I>
how much extra cabling you'd need if the photoreceptors in your eye
were spread across your entire body?  You'd need about three hundred
million extension cords to begin with, ranging from half a millimeter
to two meters long.  Which means all your signals are staggered and
out of synch, which means billions of additional logic gates to
cohere the input.  And that just gets you a single static image, with
no filtering, no interpretation, no time-series integration at all.&quot;
 Shiver.  Drag.  &quot;Now multiply that by all the extra wiring
needed to <I>focus </I>all those eyespots on an object, or to send
all that information back to individual chromatophores, and then add
in the processing power you need to <I>drive</I> those chromatophores
one at a time.  Thirty percent might do all that, but I strongly
doubt you'd have much left over for philosophy and science.&quot;  He
waved his hand in the general direction of the hold.  &quot;That-that-&quot;</P>

&quot;<I>Scrambler,</I>&quot; James suggested.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Cunningham rolled his tongue around it.  &quot;Very well.  That
<I>scrambler</I> is an absolute miracle of evolutionary engineering.
It's also dumb as a stick.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
A moment's silence.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;So what <I>is</I> it?&quot; James asked at last.  &quot;Somebody's
pet?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Canary in a coal mine,&quot; Bates suggested.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Perhaps not even that,&quot; Cunningham said.  &quot;Perhaps no
more than a white blood cell with waldoes.  Maintenance bot, maybe.
Teleoperated, or instinct-driven.  But people, we're ignoring far
greater questions here.  How could an anaerobe even develop complex
multicellular anatomy, much less move as <I>fast</I> as this thing
did?  That level of activity burns a great deal of ATP.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Maybe they don't use ATP,&quot; Bates said as I thumbnailed:
<I>adenosine triphosphate</I>.  Cellular energy source.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;It was <I>crammed</I> with ATP,&quot; Cunningham told her.
&quot;You can tell that much even with <I>these</I> remains.  The
question is, how can it synthesize the stuff fast enough to keep up
with demand.  Purely anaerobic pathways wouldn't suffice.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Nobody offered any suggestions.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Anyway,&quot; he said, &quot;So endeth the lesson.  If you want
gory details, check ConSensus.&quot;  He wiggled the fingers of his
free hand:  the spectral dissection vanished.  &quot;I'll keep
working, but if you want any real answers go get me a live one.&quot;
 He butted out his cigarette against the bulkhead and stared
defiantly around the drum.</P>

The others hardly reacted; their topologies still sparkled from the
revelations of a few minutes before.  Perhaps Cunningam's pet peeve
<I>was </I>more important to the Big Picture; perhaps, in a
reductionist universe, biochemical basics should always take priority
over the finer points of ETI and interspecies etiquette.  But Bates
and the Gang were time-lagged, processing earlier revelations.  Not
just <I>processing</I>, either:  wallowing.  They clung to
Cunningham's findings like convicted felons who'd just discovered
they might be freed on a technicality.</P>

Because the scrambler was dead at our hands, no doubt about it.  But

Robert Paglino had set me up with Chelsea in the first place.  Maybe
he felt responsible when the relationship started jumping the rails.

&quot;Thanks for the insight.&quot;  As if people had never <I>taken

when she went through my drawers and filtered my mail and followed me
from room to room, asking the drapes and the furniture why I was
always so sullen and withdrawn.  She'd taken such an interest that
she wouldn't let me out the door until I confided in her.  At twelve
I'd been stupid enough to throw myself on her mercy, <I>It's
personal, Mom.   I'd just rather not talk about it.</I>  Then I'd
made my escape into the bathroom when she demanded to know if <I>it
</I>was trouble online, trouble at school, was it a girl, was it a-a
<I>boy</I>, what <I>was</I> it and why couldn't I just <I>trust</I>
my <I>own mother</I>, don't I know I can trust her with <I>anything</I>?
 I waited out the persistent knocking and the insistent concerned
voice through the door and the final, grudging silence that followed.
 I waited until I was absolutely sure she'd gone away, I waited for
five fucking <I>hours</I> before I came out and there she was, arms
folded in the hall, eyes brimming with reproach and disappointment.
That night she took the lock off the bathroom door because <I>family

He nodded, emphatic.  &quot;You know what they say about the road
less traveled?  Well, you carved your <I>own</I> road.  I don't know
why.  It's like learning calligraphy using your toes, you know?  Or
proprioceptive polyneuropathy.  It's amazing you can do it at all;

&quot;There used to be people without any sense of-well, of
themselves, physically.  They couldn't feel their bodies in space,
had no idea how their own limbs were arranged or even if they <I>had</I>
limbs.  Some of them said they felt <I>pithed</I>.  Disembodied.
They'd send a motor signal to the hand and just have to take it on
faith that it arrived.  So they'd use vision to compensate; they
couldn't feel where the hand was so they'd <I>look </I>at it while it
moved, use sight as a substitute for the normal force-feedback you
and I take for granted.  They could walk, if they kept their eyes
focused on their legs and concentrated on every step.  They'd get
pretty good at it.  But even after years of practice, if you
distracted them in mid-step they'd go over like a beanstalk without a
counterweight.&quot;</P>

&quot;You use your <I>Chinese room</I> the way they used vision.
You've reinvented empathy, almost from scratch, and in some ways-not
<I>all</I> obviously, or I wouldn't have to tell you this-but
in some ways yours is better than the original.  It's why you're so
good at synthesis.&quot;</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;It's not. Empathy's not so much about imagining how the other

&quot;Yeah, that was someone else.  And maybe I remember him better
than you do.  But I'll tell you one thing.&quot;  He leaned forward.
&quot;<I>Both</I> of you would've helped me out that day.  And maybe
he would've got there with good ol'-fashioned empathy while you had
to cobble together some kind of improvised flowchart out of surplus

It went bad from the moment we breached.  The plan had called for
precise havoc along the new beachhead, subtly arranged to entrap some
blood-cell-with-waldoes as it sought to repair the damage.  Our job
had been to set the trap and stand back, trusting Sarasti's
assurances that we would not have long to wait.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
We had no time at all.  Something squirmed in the swirling dust the
moment we breached, serpentine movement down the hole that instantly
kicked Bates renowned <I>field initiative</I> into high gear.   Her
grunts dived through and caught a scrambler twitching in their
crosshairs, clinging to the wall of the passageway.  It must have
been stunned by the blast of our entry, a classic case of
wrong-place-wrong-time.  Bates took a split-second to appraise the
opportunity and the plan was plasma.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
One of the grunts plugged the scrambler with a biopsy dart before I
even had a chance to blink.  We would have bagged the whole animal
right then if <I>Rorschach</I>'s<I> </I>magnetosphere hadn't chosen
that moment to kick sand in our faces.  As it was, by the time our
grunts staggered back into action their quarry was already
disappearing around the bend.  Bates was tethered to her troops; they
yanked her down the rabbit hole (&quot;<I>Set it up!</I>&quot; she
yelled back at Sascha) the moment she let them loose.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I was tethered to Bates.  I barely had a chance to exchange a
wide-eyed look with Sascha before being yanked away in turn.
Suddenly I was <I>inside</I> again; the sated biopsy dart bounced off
my faceplate and flashed past, still attached to a few meters of
discarded monofilament.  Hopefully Sascha would pick it up while
Bates and I were hunting; at least the mission wouldn't be a total
loss if we never made it back.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The grunts dragged us like bait on a hook.  Bates flew like a dolphin
just ahead of me, keeping effortlessly to the center of the bore with
an occasional tweak of her jets.  I careened off the walls just
behind, trying to stabilize myself, trying to look as though I too
might be in control.  It was an important pretense.  The whole point
of being a decoy is to pass yourself off as an original.  They'd even
given me my own gun,  pure precaution of course, more for comfort
than protection.   It hugged my forearm and fired plastic slugs
impervious to induction fields.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

Gooseflesh prickled my skin as it always had.  The usual ghosts
scrabbled and clawed through my mind.  This time, though, the dread
seemed muted.  Distant.  Perhaps it was just a matter of timing,
perhaps we were moving so quickly through the magnetic landscape that
no one phantom had a chance to stick.  Or maybe it was something
else.  Maybe I wasn't so afraid of ghosts because this time we were
after monsters<I>.</I></P>

The scrambler seemed to have thrown off whatever cobwebs our entrance
had spun; it surged along the walls now at full speed, its arms
shooting ahead like a succession of striking snakes, slinging the
body forward so fast the drones could barely keep it in sight, a
writhing silhouette in the fog.  Suddenly it leapt sideways, sailing
across the width of the passageway and down some minor tributary.
The grunts veered in pursuit, crashing into walls, stumbling-</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
-stopping-</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
-and suddenly Bates was braking hard, shooting back past me as
I flailed with my pistol.  I was past the drones in the next instant;
my leash snapped tight and snapped back, bringing me to a dead
drifting stop.  For a second or two I was on the front line.  For a
second or two I <I>was</I> the front line, Siri Keeton, note taker,
mole, professional uncomprehender.   I just floated there, breath
roaring in my helmet, as a few meters further on the walls-

<I>Peristalsis</I>, I thought at first.  But this motion was utterly
unlike the slow, undulating waves that usually rippled along
<I>Rorschach</I>'s passageways.  So <I>hallucination</I>, I thought
instead- and then those writhing walls reached out with a
thousand whiplike calcareous tongues that grabbed our quarry from
every direction and <I>tore it to pieces</I>...</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Something grabbed me and spun me around.  Suddenly I was locked
against the chest of one of the grunts, its rear guns firing as we
retreated back up the tunnel at full speed.  Bates was in the arms of
the other.  Seething motion receded behind us but the image stayed
stuck to the backs of my eyes, hallucinatory and point-blank in its
clarity:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Scramblers, everywhere.  A seething infestation squirming across the
walls, reaching out for the intruder, leaping into the lumen of the
passageway to press their counterattack.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Not against us.  They had attacked one of their own.  I'd seen three
of its arms ripped off before it had disappeared into a writhing ball
in the center of the passageway.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
We fled.  I turned to Bates-<I>Did you see</I>-but held
my tongue.   The deathly concentration on her face was unmistakable
even across two faceplates and three meters of methane.  According to
HUD she'd lobotomized both grunts, bypassed all that wonderful
autonomous decision-making circuitry entirely.  She was running both
machines herself, as manually as marionettes.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
 Grainy turbulent echoes appeared on the rear sonar display.  The
scramblers had finished with their sacrifice.  Now they were coming
after us.  My grunt stumbled and careened against the side of the
passage.  Jagged shards of alien d-cor dug parallel gouges
across my faceplate, tenderized chunks of thigh through the shielded
fabric of my suit.  I clenched down on a cry.  It got out anyway.
Some ridiculous in-suit alarm chirped indignantly an instant before a
dozen rotten eggs broke open inside my helmet.  I coughed.  My eyes
stung and watered in the reek; I could barely see <I>Seiverts</I> on
the HUD, flashing instantly into the red.

My faceplate healed enough to shut off the alarm.  My air began to
clear.  The scramblers had gained;  by the time I could see clearly
again they were only a few meters behind us.  Up ahead Sascha came
into view around the bend,  Sascha who had no backup, whose other
cores had all been shut down on Sarasti's orders.  Susan had
protested at first-</P>

-so there was Sascha who was <I>more resistant to Rorschach</I>'s
<I>influence</I> according to some criterion I never understood,
curled up in a fetal ball with her gloves clamped against her helmet
and I could only hope to some dusty deity that she'd set the trap
before this place had got to her.  And here came the scramblers, and
Bates was shouting &quot;<I>Sascha!  Get out of the fucking way!</I>&quot;
and braking hard, way too soon, the scrambling horde nipping at our
heels like a riptide and Bates yelled &quot;<I>Sascha</I>!&quot;
again and finally Sascha moved, kicked herself into gear and off the
nearest wall and fled right back up the hole we'd blown in through.
Bates yanked some joystick in her head and our warrior sedans slewed
and shat sparks and bullets and dove out after her.</P>

Sascha had set the trap just within the mouth of the breach.  Bates
armed it in passing with the slap of one gloved hand.  Motion sensors
were supposed to do the rest- but the enemy was close behind,
and there was no room to spare.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
It went off just as I was emerging into the vestibule.  The cannon
net shot out behind me in a glorious exploding conic, caught
something, snapped back up the rabbit hole and slammed into my grunt
from behind.  The recoil kicked us against the top of the vestibule
so hard I thought the fabric would tear.  It held, and threw us back
against the squirming things enmeshed in our midst.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Writhing backbones everywhere.  Articulated arms, lashing like bony
whips.  One of them entwined my leg and <I>squeezed</I> like a brick
python.  Bates' hands waved in a frantic dance before me and that arm
came apart into dismembered segments, bouncing around the enclosure.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

&quot;<I>Sascha!  Launch!</I>&quot; Bates barked.  Another arm
separated from its body and careened into the wall, coiling and
uncoiling.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The hole had flooded with aerosol foam-core as soon as we'd pulled
the net.  A scrambler writhed half-embedded in that matrix, caught
just a split-second too late; its central mass protruded like some
great round tumor writhing with monstrous worms.

Artillery.  The floor of the vestibule irised shut quick as a
leg-hold trap and everything slammed against it, grunts, people,
scramblers whole and in pieces.  I couldn't breathe.  Every
thimbleful of flesh weighed a hundred kilograms.  Something slapped
us to one side, a giant hand batting an insect.  Maybe a course
correction.  Maybe a collision.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

We floated like mites in a ping-pong ball, surrounded by a confusion
of machinery and twitching body parts.  There was little of anything
that might pass for blood.  What there was floated in clear,
shuddering spherules.  The cannon net floated like a shrink-wrapped
asteroid in our midst.  The things inside had wrapped their arms
around themselves, around each other, curled into a shivering and
unresponsive ball.  Compressed methonia hissed around them, keeping
them fresh for the long trip home.

I was already feeling nauseous.  Bates was carefully bringing her
wrists together.  For a moment I could barely make out a taut dark
thread of freakwire, fine as smoke, between them.  Her caution was
well-advised; that stuff would slice through human limbs as easily as
alien ones.  One of the grunts groomed its mouthparts at her

The freakwire vanished from my sight.  Sight itself was dimming, now.
 The inside of this great lead balloon was going dark around me.  We
were coasting, purely ballistic.  We had to trust that <I>Scylla

distance from the scene of the crime.  We had to trust Sarasti.</P>

&quot;How do you <I>know</I>?&quot; Bates had asked when he'd first
laid out the plan.  He hadn't answered.  Chances are he couldn't
have, not to us, any more than a baseline could have explained brane
theory to the inhabitants of Flatland.  But Bates hadn't been asking
about tactics anyway, not really.  Maybe she'd been asking for a
<I>reason</I>, for something to justify this ongoing trespass into
foreign soil, the capture and slaughter of its natives.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
On one level she already knew the reason, of course.  We all did.  We
could not afford to merely react.  The risks were too great; we had
to <I>preempt</I>.   Sarasti, wise beyond all of us, saw this more
clearly than we.  Amanda Bates knew he was right in her mind-but
perhaps she didn't feel it in her gut.  Perhaps, I thought as my
vision failed, she was asking Sarasti to convince her.</P>

The control you wield over your troops would give wet dreams and
nightmares to generals of ages past.  You can drop instantly into the
sensorium of anyone under your command, experience the battlefield
from any number of first-person perspectives.  Your every soldier is
loyal unto death, asking no questions, obeying all commands with
alacrity and dedication to which mere flesh could never even aspire.

Taking orders comes as naturally as giving them.  Oh, you've been
known to question policy on occasion, or seek a bigger picture than
may be strictly necessary for the job at hand.  Your <I>command
initiative </I>has become the stuff of legends.  But you have never
disobeyed  a direct order.  When asked for your perspective, you
serve it straight up and unvarnished- until the decision is
made, and the orders handed down.  Then you do your job without
question.  Even when questions arise, you would hardly waste time

Not for information.  Might as well expect the sighted to explain
vision to the congenitally blind.  Not for clarification; there was
no ambiguity in Sarasti's bottom line.  Not even for the benefit of
poor dumb Siri Keeton, who may have missed some salient point but is
too ashamed to raise his own hand.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

rebellion is permitted once the word is given.</P>

You argued and advocated as forcefully as you could, back when
Sarasti was soliciting input.  But he ignored yours, abandoned any
attempt at communication and preemptively invaded foreign territory.
He knew that <I>Rorschach</I> might contain living beings and still
he tore it open without regard for their welfare.  He may have killed
helpless innocents.  He may have roused an angry giant.  You don't

You've seen this kind of arrogance before, among your own kind.  You
had hoped that smarter creatures would be wiser ones.  Bad enough to
see such arrogant stupidity inflicted on the helpless, but to do it
at these stakes beggars belief.  Killing innocents is the <I>least</I>

provoking conflict with a star faring technology whose sole offense

Your dissent has changed nothing.  So you rein it in; all that slips
out now is the occasional pointless question with no hope of an
answer, its inherent insubordination so deeply buried you don't even
see it yourself.  If you did see it, you'd keep your mouth shut
entirely-because the last thing you want is to remind Sarasti
that you think he's <I>wrong</I>.  You don't want him dwelling on
that.  You don't want him to think you're up to something.</P>

The laceration of my suit had done a real number on the gears.  It
took three solid days for <I>Theseus</I> to bring me back to life.
But death was no excuse for falling behind the curve; I resurrected
with a head full of updates clogging my inlays.</P>

I flipped through them, climbing down into the drum.  The Gang of
Four sat at the galley below me, staring at untouched portions of
nutritionally-balanced sludge on her plate.  Cunningham, over in his
inherited domain, grunted at my appearance and turned back to work,
the fingers of one hand tapping compulsively on the desktop.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<I>Theseus</I>' orbit had widened during my absence, and most of its
eccentricities had been planed away.  Now we kept our target in view
from a more-or-less constant range of three thousand kilometers.  Our
orbital period lagged <I>Rorschach</I>'s by an hour-the alien
crept implacably ahead of us along its lower trajectory-but a
supplementary burn every couple of weeks would be enough to keep it
in sight.  We had <I>specimens </I>now, things to be examined under
conditions of our own choosing; no point in risking any more close
approaches until we'd wrung every useful datum from what we had.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Cunningham had expanded his lab space during my time in the
sepulcher.  He'd built holding pens, one for each scrambler, modules
partitioned by a common wall and installed in a whole new hab.  The
microwaved carcass had been sidelined like a discarded toy from a
previous birthday, although according to the access logs Cunningham
still visited it every now and then.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Not that he visited <I>any</I> part of the new wing in person, of
course.  Not that he was even able to, not without suiting up and
jumping across the hold.  The whole compartment had been disconnected
from its spinal lock and pushed to a tethered anchorage midway
between spine and carapace:  Sarasti's orders, given to <I>minimize
risk of contamination</I>.  It was no skin off Cunningham's nose.  He
was happier leaving his body in pseudogravity anyway, while his
consciousness flitted between the waldoes and sensors and bric-a-brac
surrounding his new pets.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<I>Theseus</I> saw me coming and pushed a squeezebulb of sugary
electrolytes from the galley dispenser.  The Gang didn't look up as I
passed.  One forefinger tapped absently against their temple, the
lips pursed and twitched in the characteristic mode that said
<I>internal dialog in progress</I>.  I could never tell who was on
top when they were like that.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I sucked on the squeezebulb and looked in on the pens.  Two cubes
suffused in pale red light: in one a scrambler floated center stage,
waving its segmented arms like seaweed in gentle surge.  The occupant
of the other cage was squeezed into a corner, four arms splayed
across the converging walls; four others extended, waving again, into
open space.  The bodies from which those arms sprouted were
spheroids, not flattened disks as our first-sample had been.
They were only slightly compressed, and their arms sprouted not from
a single equatorial band but from across the whole surface.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Fully-extended, the floating scrambler was over two meters across.
The other seemed roughly the same size.  Neither moved, except for
those drifting arms.  Navy-blue mosaics, almost black in the
longwave, rippled across their surfaces like the patterns of wind on
grass.  Superimposed graphics plotted methane and hydrogen at
reassuring <I>Rorschach</I> norms.  Temperature and lighting, ditto.
An icon for ambient electromagnetics remained dark.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I dipped into the archives, watched the arrival of the aliens from
two days past; each tumbling unceremoniously into its pen, balled up,
hugging themselves as they bounced gently around their enclosures.
<I>Fetal position</I>, I thought-but after a few moments the
arms uncoiled, like the blooming of calcareous flowers.</P>

&quot;In stacks.  They have two navels each.&quot;  She managed a
weak smile, touched her belly with one hand and the small of her back
with the other.  &quot;One in front, one behind.  He thinks  they
grow in a kind of column, piled up.  When the top one develops to a

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
 The archived scramblers were exploring their new environment now,
climbing gingerly along the walls, unrolling their arms along the
corners where the panels met.  Those swollen central bodies struck me
again.  &quot;So that first one, with the flattened...&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I watched them move.  There wasn't much to explore; the walls were
almost bare, innocent of anything but a few sensor heads and gas
nozzles.  The pens had their own tentacles and manipulators for more
invasive research needs, but those had been carefully sheathed during
introduction.  Still, the creatures covered the territory in careful
increments, moving back and forth along parallel, invisible paths.
Almost as if they were running transects.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

it?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;What does Robert say about that?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;He says the behavior of honeybees and sphex wasps is just as

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

to tell the hive where the flowers are.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
She shrugged, conceding the point.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;So you still might be able to talk to these things.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Maybe.  You'd think.&quot;  She massaged her brow between thumb
and forefinger.  &quot;We haven't got anywhere, though.  We played
some of their pigment patterns back to them, with variations.  They
don't seem to make sounds.  Robert synthesized a bunch of noises that
they might squeeze out of their cloacae if they were so inclined, but
those didn't get us anywhere either.  Harmonic farts, really.&quot;
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Pretty much.  But you know, they didn't go into a loop.
Hardwired animals repeat themselves.  Even smart ones pace, or chew
their fur.  Stereotyped behaviors.  But these two, they gave
everything a very careful once-over and then just-shut down.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
They were still at it in ConSensus, slithering across one wall, then
another, then another, a slow screw-thread track that would leave no
square centimeter uncovered.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Have they done anything since?&quot; I asked.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
She shrugged again.  &quot;Nothing spectacular.  They squirm when you
poke them.  Wave their arms back and forth-they do that pretty
much constantly, but there's no information in it that we can tell.
They haven't gone invisible on us or anything.  We blanked the
adjoining wall for a while so they could see each other, even piped
audio and air feeds-Robert thought there might be some kind of
pheromonal communication-but nothing.  They didn't even react
to each other.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;With what, Siri?  They don't seem to care about their own
company.  We can't bribe them with food unless we know what they eat,
which we don't.  Robert says they're in no immediate danger of
starvation anyway.  Maybe when they get hungry they can deal.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I killed the archival feed and reverted to realtime.  &quot;Maybe
they eat-I don't know, radiation.  Or magnetic energy.  The
cage can generate magnetic fields, right?&quot;

&quot;Tried it.&quot;  She took a breath, then squared her shoulders.
 &quot;But I guess these things take time.  He's only had a couple of

He stood at his post in BioMed, though his empty chair was barely a

policy.</P>

Cunningham sank into his chair without looking at me.  In his head,
and in mine, a new window opened within a frame marked
<I>Electrophoresis</I>.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

&quot;What can I do for you, Siri?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I was hoping you could bring me up to speed on your findings.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
A periodic chart of alien elements scrolled through the feed.
Cunningham logged it and started another sample.  &quot;I've
documented everything.  It's all in ConSensus.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I made a play for ego:  &quot;It would really help to know how <I>you'd</I>
thumbnail it, though.  What you think is important can be just as
vital as the data themselves.&quot;</P>

He looked at me a moment.  He muttered something, repetitive and
irrelevant.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;What's important is what's <I>missing</I>,&quot; he said after
a moment.  &quot;I've got good samples now and I still can't find the
genes.  Protein synthesis is almost prionic-reconformation
instead of the usual transcription pathways-but I can't figure
out how those bricks get slotted into the wall once they're made.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Any progress on the energy front?&quot; I asked.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Energy?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Aerobic metabolism on an anaerobe budget, remember? You said
they had too much ATP.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;That I solved.&quot;   He puffed smoke; far to stern a fleck of
alien tissue liquefied and banded into chemical strata.  &quot;They're
sprinting.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He sighed.  &quot;Biochemistry is a tradeoff.  The faster you
synthesize ATP, the more expensive each molecule becomes.  It turns
out scramblers are a lot more energy-efficient at making it than we
are.  They're just extremely slow at it, which might not be a big
drawback for something that spends most of its time inactive.
<I>Rorschach-</I>whatever <I>Rorschach</I> started out as-
could have drifted for millennia before it washed up here.  That's a
lot of time to build up an energy reserve for bouts of high activity,
and once you've laid the groundwork glycolysis is <I>explosive</I>.
Two-thousand-fold boost, and no oxygen demand.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Scramblers <I>sprint</I>.  Their whole lives.&quot;
</P>

&quot;They may come preloaded with ATP and burn it off throughout
their lifespan.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;How long would that be?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Good question,&quot; he admitted.  &quot;Live fast, die young.
If they ration it out, stay dormant most of the time-who
knows?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Huh.&quot; The free-floating scrambler had drifted away from
the center of its pen.  One extended arm held a wall at bay; the
others continued their hypnotic swaying.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

&quot;They tore it to pieces.&quot;</P>

&quot;Any idea why?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He shrugged.  &quot;Bates thought there might be some kind of civil

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;What do you think?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I don't know.  Maybe it's right, or maybe scramblers are ritual
cannibals, or-they're <I>aliens</I>, Keeton.  What do you want
from me?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;But they're not <I>really</I> aliens.  At least not intelligent

&quot;Are <I>scramblers</I> even alive?&quot; I asked.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;What kind of question is that?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;You think <I>Rorschach</I> grows them on some kind of assembly

machines.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;That's what life <I>is</I>, Keeton.  That's what <I>you</I>
are.&quot; Another hit of nicotine, another storm of numbers, another
sample.  &quot;Life isn't either/or.  It's a matter of degree.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;What I'm asking is, are they <I>natural</I>?  Could they be
constructs?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Is a termite mound a construct?  Beaver dam?  Space ship?  Of
course.  Were they built by naturally-evolved organisms, acting
naturally?  They were.  So tell me how anything in the whole deep
multiverse can ever be anything <I>but </I>natural?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I tried to keep the irritation out of my voice.  &quot;You know what
I mean.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;It's a meaningless question.  Get your head out of the
Twentieth Century.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I gave up.  After a few seconds Cunningham seemed to notice the
silence.  He withdrew his consciousness from the machinery and looked
around with fleshly eyes, as if searching for some mosquito that had
mysteriously stopped whining.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;What's your problem with me?&quot; I asked.  Stupid question,
obvious question.  Unworthy of any synthesist to be so, so <I>direct</I>.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
His eyes glittered in that dead face.  &quot;Processing without

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;That's a colossal oversimplification.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Mmm.&quot;  Cunningham nodded.  &quot;Then why can't you seem
to <I>comprehend</I> how pointless it is to keep peeking over our
shoulders and writing home to our masters?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Someone has to keep Earth in the loop.&quot;</P>

&quot;We're on our own out here, Keeton.  <I>You're</I> on your own.
The game's going to be long over before our masters even know it's
started.&quot; He sucked smoke.  &quot;Or perhaps not.  Perhaps
you're talking to someone closer, hmm?  That it?  Is the Fourth Wave
telling you what to do?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;There is no Fourth Wave.  Not that anyone's told me, anyway.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Probably not.  They'd never risk <I>their</I> lives out here,
would they?  Too dangerous even to hang back and watch from a
distance.  That's why they built <I>us</I>.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;We're all self-made.  Nobody forced you to get the rewire.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;No, nobody <I>forced</I> me to get the rewire.  I could have
just let them cut out my brain and pack it into Heaven, couldn't I?
That's the <I>choice</I> we have.  We can be utterly useless, or we
can try and compete against the vampires and the constructs and the
AIs.  And perhaps <I>you</I> could tell me how to do that without
turning into a-an utter freak.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
So much in the voice.  Nothing at all on the face.  I said nothing.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;See what I mean?  No comprehension.&quot;  He managed a tight
smile.  &quot;So I'll answer your questions.  I'll delay my own work
and hold your hand because Sarasti's told us to.  I guess that
superior vampire mind sees some legitimate reason to indulge your
constant ankle-nipping, and it's in charge so I'll play along.  But
I'm not nearly that smart, so you'll forgive me if it all seems a bit

Even back on Earth, Robert Cunningham had barely disguised his
opinion of the ship's <I>commissar</I>.  It had been obvious even to
the topologically blind.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I'd always had a hard time imagining the man.  It wasn't just his
expressionless face.  Sometimes, not even the subtler things behind
would show up in his topology.  Perhaps he repressed them
deliberately, resenting the presence of this mole among the crew.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
It would hardly have been the first time I'd encountered such a
reaction.  Everyone resented me to some extent.  Oh, they liked me
well enough, or thought they did.  They tolerated my intrusions, and
cooperated, and gave away far more than they thought they did.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
But beneath Szpindel's gruff camaraderie, beneath James's patient
explanations-there was no real respect.  How could there be?
These people were the bleeding edge, the incandescent apex of hominid
achievement.  They were trusted with the fate of the world.  I was
just a tattletale for small minds back home.  Not even that much,
when home receded too deeply into the distance.  Superfluous mass.
Couldn't be helped.  No use getting bothered over it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Still, Szpindel had only coined <I>commissar</I> half-jokingly.
Cunningham <I>believed</I> it, and didn't laugh.  And while I'd
encountered many others like him over the years, those had only <I>tried</I>
to hide themselves from sight.  Cunningham was the first who seemed
to succeed.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I tried to build the relationship all the way through training, tried
to find the missing pieces.  I watched him working the simulator's
teleops one day, exercising the shiny new interfaces that spread him
through walls and wires.  He was practicing his surgical skills on
some hypothetical alien the computer had conjured up to test his
technique.  Sensors and jointed teleops sprouted like the legs of an
enormous spider crab from an overhead mount.  Spirit-possessed, they
dipped and weaved around some semiplausible holographic creature.
Cunningham's own body merely trembled slightly, a cigarette jiggling
at the corner of its mouth.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I waited for him to take a break.  Eventually the tension ebbed from
his shoulders.  His vicarious limbs relaxed.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He didn't turn.  Above the dissection, sensors swiveled and stared
back like dismembered eyestalks.  <I>That</I> was the center of
Cunningham's awareness right now, not this nicotine-stained body in
front of me.  <I>Those </I>were his eyes, or his tongue, or whatever
unimaginable bastard-senses he used to parse what the machines sent
him.  Those clusters aimed back at me, at <I>us</I>-and if
Robert Cunningham still possessed anything that might be called
vision, he was watching himself from eyes two meters outside his own
skull.

enhancements?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<I>Enhancements</I>.  As though he'd upgraded his wardrobe instead of

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;It's vital to keep current,&quot; he said.  &quot;If you don't
reconfigure you can't retrain.  If you don-t retrain you're
obsolete inside a month, and then you're not much good for anything
except Heaven or dictation.&quot;</P>

&quot;Ah.&quot;  He nodded; at the far end of shared motor nerves,
teleops jiggled in sympathy.  &quot;Change the eyes that look at the
world, change the <I>me</I> does the looking?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

Now he was watching me with fleshly eyes.  Across the membrane those
snakes and eyestalks returned to their work on the virtual carcass,
as if deciding they'd wasted enough time on pointless distractions.
I wondered which body he was in now.

He was right, of course.  I wasn't interested in Cunningham's <I>words</I>;
those were just the carrier wave.  He couldn't hear the <I>real</I>

volumes, and although their voices were strangely fuzzed with
feedback and distortion I knew I'd be able to understand them

&quot;The thing is,&quot; Chelsea said, &quot;this whole first-person
thing takes <I>effort</I>.  You have to care enough to <I>try</I>,
you know?  I've been working my ass off on this relationship, I've
been working so hard, but you just don't seem to <I>care</I>...&quot;</P>

She thought she was breaking the news.  She thought I hadn't seen it
coming, because I hadn't said anything.  I'd probably seen it before
she had.  I hadn't said anything because I'd been scared of giving
her an opening.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I felt sick to my stomach.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I care about you,&quot; I said.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;As much as you could care about anything,&quot; she admitted.
&quot;But you-I mean, sometimes you're fine, Cygnus, sometimes
you're wonderful to be around but whenever anything gets the least
bit intense you just go away and leave this, this <I>battle computer</I>
running your body and I just can't <I>deal</I> with it any more...&quot;</P>

I stared at the butterfly on the back of her hand.  Its wings flexed
and folded, lazy and iridescent.  I wondered how many of those
tattoos she had; I'd seen five of them on different body parts,
albeit only one at a time.  I thought about asking her, but this
didn't seem like the right moment.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;You can be so-so brutal sometimes,&quot; she was saying.
&quot;I know you don't mean to be, but...  I don't know.  Maybe I'm
your pressure-release valve, or something.  Maybe you have to
submerge yourself so much on the job that everything just, just
builds up and you need some kind of punching bag.  Maybe that's why
you say the things you do.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
She was waiting for me to say something now.  &quot;I've been
honest,&quot; I said.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Yeah.  Pathologically.  Have you ever had a negative thought
that you <I>haven't</I> said out loud?&quot;  Her voice trembled but
her eyes-for once- stayed dry.  &quot;I guess it's as
much my fault as yours.  Maybe more.  I could tell you
were-disconnected, from the day we met.  I guess on some level
I always saw it coming.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Why even try, then?  If you knew we were just going to crash
and burn like this?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Oh, Cygnus.  Aren't you the one who says that <I>everyone</I>
crashes and burns eventually?  Aren't you the one who says it <I>never</I>
lasts?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

I frowned, astonished that I'd even let the thought form in my head.
Chelse read the silence as a wounded one.  &quot;I guess-maybe
I thought I could help, you know?  Help fix whatever made you so-so

so scared of being <I>manipulated</I> you wouldn't even try a basic

unfixable.  I dunno.  Maybe that's even something to be proud of.&quot;</P>

She gave me a sad smile.  &quot;Nothing, Siri?  Nothing at all?
There was a time you always knew exactly what to say.&quot;  She
looked back at some earlier version of me. &quot;Now I wonder if you
ever actually meant any of it.&quot;</P>

&quot;No.&quot;  She pursed her lips.  &quot;No, it isn't.  That's
not really what I'm trying to say.  I guess...it's not so much that
you don't <I>mean</I> any of it.  It's more like you don't know what
any of it <I>means</I>.&quot;</P>

The color was gone from the wings. The butterfly was a delicate
charcoal dusting, almost motionless.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I'll do it now,&quot; I said.  &quot;I'll get the tweaks.  If
it's that important to you.  I'll do it now.&quot;</P>

Maybe she wanted me to call her back.  All these words ending in
question marks, all these significant silences.  Maybe she was giving
me the opportunity to plead my case, to beg for another chance.
Maybe she wanted a reason to change her mind.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I could have tried.  <I>Please don't</I>, I could have said.  <I>I'm

But when I looked up again the butterfly was gone and so was she,
taking all baggage with her.  She carried doubt, and guilt for having
led me on.  She left believing that our incompatibility was no one's
fault, that she'd tried as hard as she could, even that <I>I</I> had
under the tragic weight of all my issues.  She left, and maybe she
didn't even blame me, and I never even knew who'd made that final

Susan James bounced around the drum like a pronking wildebeest in the

away.  &quot;Check your feeds! Check your feeds!  <I>The pens!</I>&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
James landed at my side with a two-footed thump, wobbling for

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

&quot;Okay, they're not doing it now.&quot;  James brought up a

she pronounced, replaying the record with the audio cranked and
filtered.</P>

In the right side of the window, the floating scrambler had drifted
so that the tip of one outstretched arm brushed against the wall that
adjoined the other pen.  In the left side, the huddled scrambler
remained unmoving.</P>

Cunningham zoomed the splitscreen.  The huddled scrambler had
remained motionless, except for the rippling of its cuticle and the
undulation of its free arms.  But before I'd only seen eight arms-and
now I could make out the bony spur of a ninth peeking from behind the
central mass.  A ninth arm, curled up and hidden from view, <I>tick

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
But <I>Theseus</I> had been watching, and was way ahead of us.  It
had already searched the archives and served up the results:  three
similar exchanges over two days, ranging in duration from a tenth of
a second to almost two.</P>

Cunningham shrugged, a forgotten cigarette burning down between his

exchange they're not exactly doing calculus.  You could get as much
information out of a dancing honeybee.&quot;</P>

Susan James-congenital optimist, high priestess of the Church
of the Healing Word, was best qualified to design and execute the
protocols.  Now, at her command, the scramblers writhed.  They pulled
themselves around their cages in elliptical loops, desperately
seeking any small corner free of stimulus.  James had piped the feed
into ConSensus, although there was no mission-critical reason for
<I>Theseus</I>' whole crew to bear witness to the interrogation.</P>

Biotelemetry danced across the headspace beside each alien, luminous
annotations shuddering through thin air.  I had no idea what
constituted normal readings for these creatures, but I couldn't
imagine those jagged spikes passing for anything but bad news.  The

She denied them multiple choice, showed them the beginning of a whole

&quot;It's not your interrogation, for whatever that's worth,&quot;
the biologist continued.  &quot;As far as I can determine, some of

Bates, speaking up from across the drum.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;<I>No</I>,&quot; Cunningham said, slowly and distinctly,
&quot;<I>obviously</I> those parts aren't available to the organism.
Because they're falling apart pretty much the same way you'd expect
one of <I>us</I> to, if-if all the mitotic spindles in our
cells just <I>vanished</I> out of the cytoplasm, for example.  As far
as I can tell they started deteriorating the moment we took them off
<I>Rorschach</I>.&quot;</P>

biochemistry <I>behind</I>?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Some essential nutrient?&quot; Bates suggested.  &quot;They're
not eating-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Yes to the linguist.  No to the major.&quot;  Cunningham fell
silent;  I glanced across the drum to see him sucking on a cigarette.
 &quot;I think a lot of the cellular processes in these things are
mediated externally.  I think the reason I can't find any genes in my
biopsies is because they don't <I>have</I> any.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;So what do they have instead?&quot; Bates asked.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Turing morphogens.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Blank looks, subtitling looks.  Cunningham explained anyway:  &quot;A
lot of biology doesn't use genes.  Sunflowers look the way they do
because of purely physical buckling stress.   You get Fibonacci
sequences and Golden ratios everywhere in nature, and there's no gene
that codes for them; it's all just mechanical interactions.  Take a
developing embryo-the genes say <I>start growing</I> or <I>stop
growing</I>, but the number of digits and vertebrae result from the
mechanics of cells bumping against other cells.  Those mitotic
spindles I mentioned?  Absolutely essential for replication in every
eukaryotic cell, and they accrete like crystals without any genetic
involvement.  You'd be surprised how much of life is like that.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;But you still need <I>genes</I>,&quot; Bates protested, walking
around to join us.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Genes just establish the starting conditions to enable the
process.  The structure that proliferates afterwards doesn't need
specific instructions.  It's classic emergent complexity.  We've
known about it for over a century.&quot;  Another drag on the stick.
&quot;Or even longer.  Darwin cited honeycomb way back in the
eighteen hundreds.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Honeycomb,&quot; Bates repeated.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Perfect hexagonal tubes in a packed array.  Bees are hardwired
to lay them down, but how does an insect know enough geometry to lay
down a precise hexagon?  It doesn't.  It's programmed to chew up wax
and spit it out while turning on its axis, and that generates a
circle.  Put a bunch of bees on the same surface, chewing
side-by-side, and the circles abut against each other-deform
each other into hexagons, which just happen to be more efficient for
close packing anyway.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Bates pounced:  &quot;But the <I>bees</I> are programmed.
<I>Genetically</I>.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;You misunderstand.  Scramblers are the <I>honeycomb</I>.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;<I>Rorschach </I>is the bees,&quot; James murmured.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Cunningham nodded.  &quot;<I>Rorschach</I> is the bees.  And I don't
think <I>Rorschach</I>'s magnetic fields are counterintrusion
mechanisms at all.  I think they're part of the life-support system.
I think they mediate and regulate a good chunk of scrambler
metabolism.  What we've got back in the hold is a couple of creatures
dragged out of their element and holding their breath.  And they
can't hold it forever.&quot;</P>

There was no vampire opacity to that logic, no multidimensional black
boxes for humans to shrug at and throw up their hands.  There was no
excuse for the failure to find fault with Sarasti's reasoning, beyond
the fact that his reasoning was without fault.  That made it worse.

Now <I>Theseus</I> gave birth by Caesarian.  These progeny were far
too massive to fit through the canal at the end of the spine.  The
ship shat them as if constipated, directly into the hold:  great
monstrous things, bristling with muzzles and antennae.  Each stood
three or four times my height, a pair of massive rust-colored cubes,
every surface infested with topography.  Armor plating would hide
most of it prior to deployment, of course.  Ribbons of piping and
conduit, ammunition reservoirs and shark-toothed rows of radiator
fins- all to disappear beneath smooth reflective shielding.
Only a few island landmarks would rise above that surface:  comm
ports, thrust nozzles, targeting arrays.  And gun ports, of course.
These things spat fire and brimstone from a half-dozen mouths apiece.</P>

Bates winced at the names.  &quot;So?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Well, some might think it odd that <I>Theseus</I> wouldn't have
seen it first.  Since quantum computers are supposed to be so
proficient at pattern-matching.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Sarasti took the quantum modules offline.  The onboard's been
running in classical mode since before we even made orbit.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;<I>Why</I>?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Noisy environment.  Too much risk of decoherence.  Quantum

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Surely the onboard's shielded.  <I>Theseus</I> is shielded.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Bates nodded.  &quot;As much as feasible.  But perfect shielding is
perfect blindness, and this is not the kind of neighborhood where you
want to keep your eyes closed.&quot;</P>

I took her other point, too, the one she didn't speak aloud:  <I>And

&quot;Sarasti knows what he's doing, I guess,&quot; I admitted,

wrong yet, as far as we know.&quot;</P>

&quot;<I>If you could second-guess a vampire, you wouldn't need a

&quot;You don't buy it?&quot; I asked, but she was already thinking
she'd said too much.  I threw out a hook baited with just the right
mix of skepticism and deference:  &quot;Sarasti <I>did</I> know where
those scramblers would be.  Nailed it almost the meter, out of that
whole maze.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I suppose that might have taken some kind of superhuman logic,&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; I said.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Bates shrugged.  &quot;Or maybe he just realized that since <I>Rorschach</I>

No matter <I>where</I> we landed.&quot;</P>

ConSensus bleeped into my silence.  &quot;Orbital maneuvers starting

&quot;Sorry?&quot;</P>

Cunningham and the Gang in BioMed, thirty degrees of arc between
them. Each poked their captives in their own way.  Susan James
stabbed indifferently at a keypad painted across her desktop.
Windows to either side looked in on Stretch and Clench.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Cookie-cutter shapes scrolled across the desk as James typed:
circles, triskelions, a quartet of parallel lines.  Some of them
pulsed like abstract little hearts.  In his distant pen, Stretch
reached out one fraying tentacle and tapped something in turn.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Any progress?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
She sighed and shook her head.  &quot;I've given up trying to
understand their language.  I'm settling for a pidgin.&quot;  She
tapped an icon.  Clench vanished from his window; a hieroglyphic
flowchart sprang up in his place.  Half the symbols wriggled or
pulsed, endlessly repetitive, a riot of dancing doodles.  Others just
sat there.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Iconic base.&quot; James waved vaguely at the display.
&quot;Subject-Verb phrases render as animated versions of noun icons.
 They're radially symmetrical, so I array modifiers in a circular
pattern around the central subject.  Maybe that comes naturally to
them.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
A new circle of glyphs appeared beneath James's-Stretch's
reply, presumably.  But something in the system didn't like what it
saw.  Icons flared in a separate window:  a luminous counter flashed
500 Watts, and held steady.  On the screen, Stretch writhed.  It
reached out with squirming backbone-arms and stabbed repeatedly at
its touchpad.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
James looked away.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
New glyphs appeared.  500 Watts retreated to zero.  Stretch returned
to its holding pattern; the spikes and jags of its telemetry
smoothed.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
James let out her breath.   &quot;What happened?&quot; I asked.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Wrong answer.&quot;  She tapped into Stretch's feed, showed me
the display that had tripped it up.  A pyramid, a star, simplified
representations of a scrambler and of <I>Rorschach</I> rotated on the
board.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;It was stupid, it was just a-a warm-up exercise, really.
I asked it to name the objects in the window.&quot; She laughed
softly and without humor.  &quot;That's the thing about <I>functional</I>
languages, you know.  If you can't point at it, you can't talk about
it.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;And what did it say?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
She pointed at Stretch's first spiral:  &quot;Polyhedron star
<I>Rorschach</I> are present.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;It missed the scrambler.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Got it right the second time.  Still, stupid mistake for
something that can think rings around a vampire, isn't it?&quot;
Susan swallowed.  &quot;I guess even scramblers slip up when they're
dying.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I didn't know what to say.  Behind me, barely audible, Cunningham
muttered some two-stroke mantra to himself in an endless loop.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Jukka says-&quot;  Susan stopped, began again:  &quot;You
know that <I>blindsight</I> we get sometimes, in <I>Rorschach</I>?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I nodded, and wondered what Jukka had said.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Apparently the same thing can happen to the other senses too,&quot;
she told me.  &quot;You can have blind<I>touch</I>, and blind<I>smell</I>,
and blind<I>hearing</I>...&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;That would be deafness.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
She shook her head.  &quot;But it isn't really, is it?  Any more than
blind<I>sight</I> is really blindness.  <I>Something </I>in your head
is still taking it all in.  Something in the brain is still seeing,
and hearing, even if you're not-aware of it.  Unless someone
forces you to <I>guess</I>, or there's some threat.  You just get a
really strong feeling you should move out of the way, and five
seconds later a bus drives over the spot you were standing.  You <I>knew</I>
it was coming, somehow.  You just don't know <I>how</I> you knew.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;It's wild,&quot; I agreed.</P>

&quot;These scramblers-they <I>know</I> the answers, Siri.
They're intelligent, we <I>know</I> they are.  But it's almost as
though <I>they</I> don't know they know, unless you hurt them.  As if
they've got blindsight spread over every sense.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I tried to imagine it:  life without sensation, without any active
awareness of one's environment.  I tried to imagine existing like
that without going mad.  &quot;Do you think that's possible?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I don't know.  It's just a-a metaphor, I guess.&quot;

&quot;At first I just thought they were resisting,&quot; she said,
&quot;but why <I>would</I> they?&quot;  She turned bright, begging
eyes on me, pleading for an answer.

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I didn't have one.  I didn't have a clue.  I turned away from Susan
James, only to find myself facing Robert Cunningham:  Cunningham the
mutterer, fingers tapping against tabletop interfaces, inner eyes
blinded, vision limited now to the pictures ConSensus sketched in
airspace or threw against flat surfaces for everyone to see.  His
face remained as empty of feeling as it had ever been; the rest of
his body twitched like a bug in a spiderweb.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He might as well have been.  We all might.   <I>Rorschach</I> loomed
barely nine kilometers away now, so near it might have eclipsed Ben
itself if I'd been brave enough to look outside.  We had closed to
this insane proximity and <I>parked.</I>   Out there, <I>Rorschach</I>
grew like a live thing.  <I>In</I> there, live things grew, budded
like jellyfish from some demonic mechanical substrate.  Those lethal,
vacant corridors we'd crept along, frightened of the shadows planted
in our heads-they were probably filling with scramblers right
now.  All those hundreds of kilometers of twisted tunnels and
passages and chambers.  Filling with an army.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
This was Sarasti's safer alternative.  This was the path we'd
followed because it would have been <I>too dangerous</I> to release
the prisoners.   We were so deep inside the bow shock that we'd had
to shut down our internal augments; while <I>Rorschach</I>'s
magnetosphere was orders of magnitude weaker here than within the
structure itself, who knew if the alien might find us too tempting a
target-or too great a threat-at this range?  Who knew
when it might choose to plunge some invisible spike through <I>Theseus</I>'s
heart?</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Any pulse that could penetrate the ship's shielding would doubtless
fry <I>Theseus</I>'s nervous system as well as the wiring in our
heads.  I supposed that five people in a dead ship would have a
marginally greater chance of survival if their brains weren't
sparking in the bargain, but I doubted that such a difference would
<I>make</I> much difference.  Sarasti had obviously figured the odds
differently.  He'd even shut down the antiEuclidean pump in his own
head, resorted to manual injections to keep <I>himself</I> from
short-circuiting.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Stretch and Clench were even closer to <I>Rorschach</I> than we were.
 Cunningham's lab had been kicked free of the ship; it floated now
just a few kilometers from the artefact's outermost spires, deep
within the folds of its magnetic field.  If the scramblers needed
radioactive magnetite to function, this was the most they were going
to get:  a taste of the fields, but not of freedom.  The lab's
shielding was being dynamically fine-tuned to balance medical
necessity against tactical risk, as best the data allowed.  The
structure floated in the watchful crosshairs of our newborn gun
emplacements, strategically positioned to either side.  Those
emplacements could destroy the hab in an instant.  They could
probably destroy anything approaching it as well.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
They couldn't destroy <I>Rorschach</I>, of course.  Maybe nothing
could.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Covert to invulnerable.  As far as we knew that hadn't happened yet.
Presumably <I>Theseus</I> could still do something about the artefact
accreting off our bow, assuming we could decide which thing to do.
Sarasti wasn't talking.  In fact,  I couldn't remember the last time
any of us had even <I>seen</I> the vampire in the flesh.  For several
shifts now he had confined himself to his tent, speaking only through
ConSensus.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Everyone was on edge, and the transient had gone quiet.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Cunningham muttered to himself, stabbed at unfamiliar controls with
unpracticed fingers, cursed his own clumsiness.  Stimulus and
response flowed through lasers across six kilometers of ionized
vacuum.  The ever-present nicotine stick hung from one corner of his
mouth for want of a free hand.  Every now and then flecks of ash
broke free and drifted obliquely towards the ventilators.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He spoke before I could.  &quot;It's all in ConSensus.&quot;  When I
didn't leave he relented, but wouldn't look at me:   &quot;Magnetite
flecks lined up as soon as they got past the wavefront, more or less.
 Membranes started to fix themselves.  They're not failing as fast.
But it's <I>Rorschach</I>'s <I>internal</I> environment that will be
optimized for scrambler metabolism.  Out here, I think the most we
can do is slow the rate of dying.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;That's something, at least.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Cunningham grunted.  &quot;Some of the pieces are coming together.
Others-their nerves are frayed, for no good reason.  Literally.
 Signal leakage along the cables.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Because of their deterioration?&quot; I guessed.</P>

&quot;And I can't get the Arrhenius equation to balance, there's all
this nonlinearity at low temperatures.  The preexponential value's
completely fucked up.  It's almost as though temperature doesn't

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Some critical value had exceeded a confidence limit on one of his
displays.  He glanced up the drum, raised his voice:  &quot;Need
another biopsy, Susan.  Anywhere central.&quot;</P>

&quot;What-oh.  Just a second.&quot;  She shook her head and
tapped off a brief spiral of icons, as listless as the captives she
commanded.  On one of Cunningham's windows Stretch viewed her input
with its marvelous sighted skin.   It floated unresponsive for a
moment.  Then it folded back the arms facing one wall, opening a
clear path for Cunningham's teleops.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He called two of them from their burrows like prehensile serpents.
The first wielded a clinical core-sampler; the second wielded the
threat of violence in case of foolish resistance.  It was hardly
necessary.  Blindsighted or not, scramblers were fast learners.
Stretch exposed its belly like a victim resigned to imminent rape.
Cunningham fumbled; the teleops bumped together, briefly entangled.
He cursed and tried again, every move shouting frustration.  His
extended phenotype had been amputated; once the very ghost in the
machine, now he was just another guy punching buttons, and-

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He got it right the second time.  The tip of his machine shot out
like a striking snake and darted back again, almost too fast to see.
Waves of color flushed from Stretch's injury like ripples chased

No one does.  But most people don't think that's what I'm doing.
They don't know how much their bodies betray when they close their
mouths.  When they speak aloud, it's because they want to confide;
when they don't, they think they're keeping their opinions to
themselves.  I watch them so closely, customize each word so that no
system ever feels <I>used</I>- and yet for some reason, that
didn't work with Robert Cunningham.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Imagine you are a synthesist.  You deal in the behavior of systems at

reflections <I>above</I>.  That is the secret of your success:  you
understand the system by understanding the boundaries that contain
it.</P>

Robert Cunningham's flesh could not contain him.  His duties pulled
him beyond the meat sack; here in the Oort, his topology rambled all
over the ship.  That was true of all of us, to some extent; Bates and
her drones, Sarasti and his limbic link-even the ConSensus
inlays in our heads <I>diffused</I> us a bit, spread us just slightly
beyond the confines of our own bodies.  But Bates only ran her
drones; she never <I>inhabited</I> them.  The Gang of Four may have
run multiple systems on a single motherboard, but each had its own
distinct topology and they only surfaced one at a time.  And Sarasti-</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Well, Sarasti was a whole different story, as it turned out.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Cunningham didn't just operate his remotes; he <I>escaped</I> into
them, wore them like a secret identity to hide the feeble Human
baseline within.  He had sacrificed half of his neocortex for the
chance to see x-rays and taste the shapes hiding in cell membranes,
he had butchered one body to become a fleeting tenant of many.
Pieces of him hid in the sensors and manipulators that lined the
scrambler's cages;  I might have gleaned vital cues from every piece
of equipment in the subdrum if I'd ever thought to look.  Cunningham
was a topological jigsaw like everyone else, but half his pieces were
hidden in machinery.  My model was incomplete.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I don't think he ever aspired to such a state.  Looking back, I see
radiant self-loathing on every remembered surface.  But there in the
waning years of the twenty-first century, the only alternative he
could see was the life of a parasite.  Cunningham merely chose the
lesser evil.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Now, even that was denied him.   Sarasti's orders had severed him
from his own sensorium.  He no longer <I>felt</I> the data in his
gut; he had to <I>interpret</I> it,  step by laborious step, through
screens and graphs that reduced perception to flat empty shorthand.
Here was a system traumatized by multiple amputations.  Here was a
system with its eyes and ears and tongue cut out, forced to stumble
and feel its way around things it had once <I>inhabited</I>, right
down in the bone.  Suddenly there was nowhere else to hide, and all
those far-flung pieces of Robert Cunningham tumbled back into his
flesh where I could see them at last.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
It had been my mistake, all along.  I'd been so focused on modelling
other systems that I'd forgotten about the one doing the modelling.
Bad eyes are only one bane of clear vision:  bad assumptions can be
just as blinding, and it wasn't enough to imagine I was Robert
Cunningham.</P>

Of course, that only raises another question.  If my guess about
Cunningham was right, why did my tricks work on Isaac Szpindel?  He
was every bit as discontinuous as his replacement.</P>

I didn't think about it much at the time.  Szpindel was gone but the

Maybe my tricks didn't work on Isaac either, not really.  Maybe he
saw through my manipulations as easily as Cunningham did.  But maybe
he just didn't care.  Maybe I could read him because he <I>let</I>
me.  Which would mean- I can't find another explanation that

The drum turned quietly, lights dimmed in deference to a diel cycle
that a hundred years of tweaks and retrofits hadn't been able to weed
from the genes.  I sat alone in the galley, squinting from the inside

four minutes.  I'd assumed he was reciting the Kaddish for
Szpindel-ConSensus said he'd be doing it twice daily for the

the spinal bundles in the core, I could read his surfaces as clearly

I stood and paced the drum.  Ceiling turned into wall; wall into

&quot;<SPAN LANG="en-CA">Vision's mostly a lie anyway,&quot; he
continued.  &quot;We don't really see anything except a few hi-res

the image, the movement's way too fast for the brain to integrate so

I glanced at his workspace.  The usual splitscreen glowed to one
side-realtime images of the scramblers in their pens-but
Histology, ten thousand times larger than life, took center stage.
The paradoxical neural architecture of <I>Stretch &amp; Clench</I>
glistened on the main window, flensed and labeled and overlaid by
circuit diagrams a dozen layers thick.  A dense, annotated forest of
alien trunks and brambles.  It looked a little like <I>Rorschach</I>

Cunningham shook his head.  Something that sounded disturbingly like
a giggle escaped his mouth.  &quot;I'm saying these things can see
your nerves firing from across the room, and integrate that into a
crypsis strategy, and then send motor commands to <I>act</I> on that
strategy, and then send other commands to <I>stop</I> the motion
before your eyes come back online.  All in the time it would take a
mammalian nerve impulse to make it halfway from your shoulder to your
elbow.  These things are <I>fast</I>, Keeton.  Way faster than we
could have guessed even from that high-speed whisper line they were
using.  They're bloody <I>superconductors</I>.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

possible?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Every nerve impulse generates an electromagnetic field.  That

&quot;But <I>Rorschach</I>'s EM fields are so-I mean, reading

How is it going to evolve?  Saccades are an accidental glitch in

Cunningham sat to my right, his plastic face lit from beneath by the
conference table.    He stared down into that light, rocking
slightly.  His lips went through the ongoing motions of some
inaudible incantation.  The Gang sat across from us.  To my left
Bates kept one eye on the proceedings and another on intelligence
from the front lines.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Sarasti was with us only in spirit.  His place at the head of the
table remained empty.  &quot;Tell them,&quot; he said.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;We have to get out of h-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;From the <I>beginning</I>.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Cunningham swallowed and started again.  &quot;Those frayed motor
nerves I couldn't figure out, those pointless
cross-connections-they're logic gates.  Scramblers <I>time-share</I>.
 Their sensory and motor plexii double as associative neurons during
idle time, so every part of the system can be used for cognition when
it isn't otherwise engaged.   Nothing like it ever evolved on Earth.
It means they can do a great deal of processing without a lot of
dedicated associative mass, even for an individual.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;So peripheral nerves can think?&quot;  Bates frowned.   &quot;Can
they <I>remember</I>?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Certainly.  At least, I don't see why not.&quot;  Cunningham
pulled a cigarette from his pocket.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;So when they tore that scrambler apart-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Not civil war.  Data dump.  Passing information about <I>us</I>,
most likely.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Pretty radical way to carry on a conversation,&quot; Bates
remarked.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;It wouldn't be their first choice.  I think each scrambler acts
as a node in a distributed network, when they're in <I>Rorschach</I>
at least.  But those fields would be configured down to the Angstrom,
and when we go in with our tech and our shielding and blowing <I>holes</I>
in their conductors-we bollocks up the network.  Jam the local
signal.  So they resort to a sneakernet.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He had not lit his cigarette.  He rolled the filtered end between
thumb and forefinger.  His tongue flickered between his lips like a
worm behind a mask.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Hidden in his tent, Sarasti took up the slack.  &quot;Scramblers also
use <I>Rorschach</I>'s EM for metabolic processes.  Some pathways
achieve proton transfer via heavy-atom tunneling.  Perhaps the
ambient radiation acts as a catalyst.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;<I>Tunneling</I>?&quot; Susan said.  &quot;As in <I>quantum</I>?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Cunningham nodded.  &quot;Which also explains your shielding
problems.  Partly, at least.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;But is that even <I>possible</I>?  I mean, I thought those kind
of effects only showed up under cryonic-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;<I>Forget</I> this,&quot;  Cunningham blurted.  &quot;We can
debate the biochemistry later, if we're still alive.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;What do we debate instead, Robert?&quot; Sarasti said smoothly.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;For starters, the <I>dumbest </I>of these things can look into
your head and see what parts of your visual cortex are lighting up.
And if there's a difference between that and mind-reading, it's not
much of one.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;As long as we stay out of <I>Rorschach</I>-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;That ship has <I>sailed</I>.  You people have already <I>been</I>
there. Repeatedly.  Who knows what you already did down there for no
better reason than because <I>Rorschach</I> <I>made</I> you?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Wait a second,&quot; Bates objected.  &quot;None of us were
<I>puppets</I> down there.  We hallucinated and we went blind and-and
crazy even, but we were never <I>possessed</I>.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Cunningham looked at her and snorted.  &quot;You think you'd be able
to fight the strings?  You think you'd even <I>feel</I> them?  I
could apply a transcranial magnet to your head right now and you'd
raise your middle finger or wiggle your toes or kick Siri here in the
sack and then swear on your sainted mother's grave that you only did
it because you <I>wanted</I> to.  You'd dance like a puppet and all
the time swear you were doing it of your own free will, and that's
just <I>me</I>, that's just some borderline OCD with a couple of
magnets and an MRI helmet.&quot;  He waved at the vast unknowable
void beyond the bulkhead.  Shreds of mangled cigarette floated
sideways in front of him.   &quot;Do you want to guess what <I>that</I>
can do?  For all we know we've already given them <I>Theseus</I>'
technical specs, warned them about the Icarus array, and then just
decided <I>of our own free will</I> to forget it all.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;<I>We</I> can cause those effects,&quot; Sarasti said coolly.
&quot;As you say.  Strokes cause them.  Tumors.  Random accidents.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;<I>Random?</I>  Those were <I>experiments</I>, people!  That
was <I>vivisection</I>!  They let you in so they could take you apart
and see what made you tick and you never even <I>knew</I> it.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;<I>So what</I>?&quot; the vampire snapped invisibly.  Something
cold and hungry had edged into his voice.  Human topologies shivered
around the table, skittish.

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;There's a blind spot in the center of your visual field,&quot;
Sarasti pointed out.  &quot;You can't see it.  You can't see the
saccades in your visual timestream.  Just two of the tricks you <I>know</I>
about.  Many others.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Cunningham was nodding.  &quot;That's my whole <I>point</I>.

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Not talking about case studies.  Brains are survival engines,
not truth detectors.  If self-deception promotes fitness, the brain
lies.  Stops noticing- irrelevant things.  Truth never matters.
 Only fitness.  By now you don't experience the world as it exists at
all.  You experience a simulation built from assumptions.  Shortcuts.
 <I>Lies</I>.  Whole <I>species</I> is agnosiac by default.
<I>Rorschach</I> does nothing to you that you don't already do to
yourselves.&quot;</P>

Jukka Sarasti had just given us a pep talk.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He could have shut down Cunningham's tirade-could have probably
shut down a full-scale mutiny-by just sailing into our midst
and baring his teeth.  By <I>looking</I> at us.  But he wasn't trying
to frighten us into submission, we were already nervous enough.  And
he wasn't trying to educate us either, fight fear with fact; the more
<I>facts</I> any sane person gathered about <I>Rorschach</I>, the
more fearful they'd become.  Sarasti was only trying to keep us
<I>functional</I>, lost in space on the edge of our lives, facing
down this monstrous enigma that might destroy us at any instant for
any reason.  Sarasti was trying to calm us down: <I> good meat, nice
meat</I>.  He was trying to keep us from falling apart.  <I>There
there.</I></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Sarasti was practicing <I>psychology</I>.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I looked around the table.  Bates and Cunningham and the Gang sat

Fifteen days.  Who knows what had gone into that number?   None of us
asked aloud.  Maybe Sarasti, in another fit of inept psychology, had
made it up on the spur of the moment.  Or maybe he'd derived it
before we'd even reached orbit, held it back against the
possibility-only now expired- that he might yet send us
back into the labyrinth.  I'd been half blind for half the mission; I
didn't know.</P>

The coffins lay against the rear bulkhead of the crypt-on what
would be the floor during those moments when <I>up</I> and <I>down</I>
held any meaning.  We'd slept for years on the way out.  We'd had no
awareness of time's passage-undead metabolism is far too
sluggish even to support dreams-but somehow the body knew when
it needed a change.  Not one of us had chosen to sleep in our pods
once we'd arrived.  The only times we'd done so had been on pain of
death.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

His body rested in the pod next to mine.  I coasted into the
compartment and turned left without thinking.  Five coffins:  four
open and emptied, one sealed.  The mirrored bulkhead opposite doubled
their number and the depth of the compartment.</P>

I turned right.  The body of Susan James floated back-to-back with
her own reflection, staring at an inverse tableau:  three sealed
sarcophagi,  one open.  The ebony plaque set into the retracted lid
was dark; the others shone with identical sparse mosaics of blue and
green stars.  None of them changed.  There were no scrolling ECGs, no
luminous peak-and-valley tracings marked  cardio or cns.  We could
wait here for hours, days, and none of those diodes would so much as
twinkle.  When you're undead, the emphasis is on the second syllable.</P>

The Gang's topology had said <I>Michelle</I> when I'd first arrived,

It had been two years or more, and while we still interfaced
occasionally we hadn't met in the flesh since the day she'd left.

The Realists had sown a fibrodysplasia variant outside the Boston
catacombs; an easy tweak, a single-point retroviral whose results
served both as an act of terrorism and an ironic commentary on the
frozen paralysis of Heaven's occupants.  It rewrote a regulatory gene

Chelsea started growing a new skeleton.   Her joints were calcifying
within fifteen hours of exposure, her ligaments and tendons within
twenty.  By then they were starving her at the cellular level, trying
to slow the bug by depriving it of metabolites, but they could only
buy time and not much of it.  Twenty-three hours in, her striated

I didn't need to know the details.  I could tell from her voice that
she was dying.  Obviously she wanted to say goodbye.</P>

I spent hours scouring the noosphere, looking for precedents.
There's no shortage of ways to die; I found millions of case records
dealing with the etiquette.  Last words, last vows, instruction
manuals for the soon-to-bereaved.  Palliative neuropharm.  Extended
and expository death scenes in popular fiction.  I went through it
all, assigned a dozen front-line filters to separate heat from light.</P>

By the time she called again the news was out:  acute Golem outbreak
lancing like a white-hot needle through the heart of Boston.

expected.  Names of victims withheld pending notification of kin.</P>

I still didn't know the principles, the <I>rules</I>: all I had were
examples.  Last wills and testaments; the negotiation of jumpers with
their would-be rescuers; diaries recovered from imploded submarines
or lunar crash sites.  Recorded memoirs and  deathbed confessions
rattling into flatline.   Black box transcripts of doomed spaceships
and falling beanstalks, ending in fire and static.  All of it
relevant.  None of it useful; none of it <I>her</I>.</P>

They'd made her as comfortable as possible.  The gelpad conformed to

left her in any pain.</P>

Her neck had torqued down and to the side as it petrified, left her
staring at the twisted claw that had once been her right hand.  Her
knuckles were the size of walnuts.  Plates and ribbons of ectopic
bone distended the skin of her arms and shoulders, buried her ribs in
a fibrous mat of calcified flesh.</P>

Movement was its own worst enemy.   Golem punished even the slightest
twitch, provoked the growth of fresh bone along any joints and
surfaces conspiring to motion.  Each hinge and socket had its own
nonrenewable ration of flexibility, carved in stone; every movement
depleted the account.  The body seized incrementally.  By the time
she let me look at her, Chelsea had almost exhausted her degrees of
freedom.</P>

The waste was nothing short of obscene: a third of every Human life

to lapse into unconsciousness every fifteen hours or so, if our minds

It hadn't worked out that way.  Even if we'd outgrown the need to
stay quiet and hidden during the dark hours-the only predators
left were those we'd brought back ourselves-the brain still
needed time apart from the world outside.  Experiences had to be
catalogued and filed, mid-term memories promoted to long-term ones,
free radicals swept from their hiding places among the dendrites.  We
had only reduced the need for sleep, not eliminated it-and that
incompressible residue of downtime seemed barely able to contain the
dreams and phantoms left behind.  They squirmed in my head like
creatures in a draining tidal pool.</P>

The open hatch gaped like a cave in the face of a cliff.  The pale
blue light from the spine couldn't seem to reach inside.   Sarasti
was barely more than a silhouette, black on gray, his bright bloody

I floated into Sarasti's parlor.  His face, normally paper-white, was
so flushed it looked sunburned.  <I>He gorged himself</I>, I couldn't
help thinking.  <I>He drank deep</I>.  But all that blood was his
own.  Usually he kept it deep in the flesh, favoring the vital
organs.  Vampires were efficient that way.  They only washed out
their peripheral tissues occasionally, when lactate levels got too
high.</P>

He had a needle to his throat, injected himself with three cc's of
clear liquid as I watched.  His antiEuclideans.  I wondered how often
he had to replenish them, now that he'd lost faith in the implants.
He withdrew the needle and slipped it into a sheath geckoed to a
convenient strut.  His color drained as I watched, sinking back to
the core, leaving his skin waxy and corpselike.</P>

&quot;You're here as official observer,&quot;  Sarasti said.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I observed.  His quarters were even more spartan than mine.  No
personal effects to speak of.  No custom coffin lined with
shrink-wrapped soil.  Nothing but two jumpsuits, a pouch for
toiletries, and a disconnected fiberop umbilicus half as thick as my
little finger, floating like a roundworm in formalin.  Sarasti's
hardline to the Captain.  Not even a cortical jack, I remembered.  It
plugged into the medulla, the brainstem.  That was logical enough;
that was where all the neural cabling converged, the point of
greatest bandwidth.  Still, it was a disquieting thought-that
Sarasti linked to the ship through the brain of a reptile.

An image flared on the wall, subtly distorted against the concave

The distortion distracted me.  I looked for a corrected feed in

 By now the scramblers would have seemed sick and ragged even to a
virgin audience.  They floated near the middle of their respective
compartments, segmented arms drifting aimlessly back and forth.
Membranous patches of-skin, I suppose-were peeling from
the cuticles, giving them a fuzzy, decomposing aspect.</P>

However weakened their condition, the scramblers were not yet
indifferent to pain.  They knew the game, they knew the rules;  they
dragged themselves to their respective panels and played for mercy.
Sarasti had simply invoked a step-by-step replay of some previous
sequence.    The scramblers went through it all again, buying a few
moments' intermittent respite with the same old proofs and theorems.</P>

Another readout appeared on the display; an audio alarm began
chirping somewhere nearby.  I looked at Sarasti, and back at the

Somehow I was in the corridor, staring dumbly at my right hand.  It
had been split to the heel of the palm, flopped at the end of my
wrist in two bloody, bifingered chunks.  Blood welled from the torn
edges and wouldn't fall.  Sarasti advanced through a haze of trauma
and confusion.  His face swam in and out of focus, rich with his
blood or mine.  His eyes were bright red mirrors, his eyes were time
machines.  Darkness roared around them and it was half a million
years ago and I was just another piece of meat on the African
savannah, a split-second from having its throat torn out.</P>

&quot;Do you see the problem?&quot;  Sarasti asked, advancing. A
great spider crab hovered at his shoulder.  I forced focus through
the pain: one of Bates' grunts, taking aim.  I kicked blindly, hit
the ladder through sheer happenstance, careened backwards down the
corridor.</P>

agendas.  Brains-cheat.  Feedback loops evolve to promote
stable heartbeats and then stumble upon the temptation of rhythm and
music.  The rush evoked by fractal imagery, the algorithms used for
habitat selection, metastasize into art.  Thrills that once had to be
<I>earned</I> in increments of fitness can now be had from pointless
introspection.  Aesthetics rise unbidden from a trillion dopamine
receptors, and the system moves beyond modeling the organism.   It
begins to model the very <I>process</I> of modeling.  It consumes
ever-more computational resources, bogs itself down with endless
recursion and irrelevant simulations.  Like the parasitic DNA that

I didn't need a visual feed to know what Bates thought of that.  But
there was something else in her silence, something that made me bring
the drum camera back online.  I squinted against the corrosive light,
brought down the brightness until all that remained was a faint
whisper of pastels.</P>

Even now, my tools chipped and battered, my perceptions barely more

this assault upon crew, had crossed a line in her head.  The

I peeked outside now and then, kept an eye on Tactical.  I saw <I>Scylla</I>
and <I>Charybdis</I> climb into the accretion belt and return towing
captured reaction mass in a great distended mesh between them.  I
watched our ampsat reach its destination in the middle of nowhere,
saw antimatter's quantum blueprints stream down into <I>Theseus</I>'s

forged the tools that Jukka Sarasti needed for his master plan,

I put my ear to feeds throughout the ship.  I heard routine
instructions from the predator, murmured conversations among the
prey.  I took in only sound, never sight;  a video feed would have
spilled light into my tent, left me naked and exposed.  So I listened
in the darkness as the others spoke among themselves.  It didn't
happen often any more.  Perhaps too much had been said already,
perhaps there was nothing left to do but mind the countdown.
Sometimes hours would pass with no more than a cough or a grunt.

That was Cunningham, talking to Sascha about zombies.  I heard them
in the galley over breakfast, unusually talkative.  Sascha hadn't
been let out for a while, and was making up for lost time.
Cunningham let her, for reasons of his own.  Maybe his fears had been
soothed somehow, maybe Sarasti had revealed his master plan.  Or
maybe Cunningham simply craved distraction from the imminence of the
enemy.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;It doesn't <I>bug</I> you?&quot;  Sascha was saying.  &quot;Thinking

but some kind of parasite?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Forget about <I>minds</I>,&quot; he told her.  &quot;Say you've
got a device designed to monitor-oh, cosmic rays, say.  What
happens when you turn its sensor around so it's not pointing at the
sky anymore, but at its own guts?&quot;  He answered himself before
she could:  &quot;It does what it's built to.  It measures cosmic
rays, even though it's not looking at them any more.  It parses its
own circuitry in terms of cosmic-ray metaphors, because those <I>feel</I>
right, because they feel natural, because it can't look at things any
other way.  But it's the <I>wrong metaphor</I>.  So the system
misunderstands everything about itself.  Maybe that's not a grand and
glorious evolutionary leap after all.  Maybe it's just a design
flaw.&quot;</P>

&quot;So sentience has gotta be <I>good</I> for something, then.

&quot;You're not thinking this through,&quot; Cunningham said.
&quot;We're not talking about some kind of zombie lurching around
with its arms stretched out, spouting mathematical theorems.  A smart
automaton would <I>blend in</I>.  It would observe those around it,
mimic their behavior, act just like everyone else.  All the while
completely unaware of what it was doing.  Unaware even of its own
existence.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Why would it bother?  What would motivate it?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;As long as you pull your hand away from an open flame, who
cares whether you do it because it <I>hurts</I> or because some
feedback algorithm says <I>withdraw if heat flux exceeds critical T</I>?
 Natural selection doesn't care about <I>motives</I>.   If
impersonating something increases fitness, then nature will select
good impersonators over bad ones.  Keep it up long enough and no
conscious being would be able to pick your zombie out of a crowd.&quot;
 Another silence; I could hear him chewing through it.  &quot;It'll
even be able to participate in a conversation like this one.  It
could write letters home, impersonate real human feelings, without
having the slightest awareness of its own existence.&quot;</P>

&quot;Oh, it might not be perfect.  It might be a bit redundant, or

&quot;Perhaps.  Depends on the population dynamics, among other
things.  But I'd guess that at least one thing an automaton lacks is
empathy; if you can't feel, you can't really relate to something that
does, even if you <I>act</I> as though you do.  Which makes it
interesting to note how many sociopaths show up in the world's upper
echelons, hmm?  How ruthlessness and bottom-line self-interest are so
lauded up in the stratosphere, while anyone showing those traits at
ground level gets carted off into detention with the Realists.

&quot;Maybe the ones that get diagnosed don't, but by definition
they're the bottom of the class.  The others are too smart to get
caught, and <I>real</I> automatons would do even better.  Besides,

But that was as close to a direct reference to Siri Keeton that I

The shame had scoured me and left me hollow.  I didn't care who saw
me.  I didn't care what state they saw me in.  For days I'd floated
in my tent, curled into a ball and breathing my own stink while the
others made whatever preparations my tormentor had laid out for them.
 Amanda Bates was the only one who'd raised even a token protest over

No one in the spine.  Only Cunningham visible in BioMed, poring over
digital dissections, pretending to kill time.  I floated above him,
my rebuilt hand clinging to the top of the nearest stairwell; it
dragged me in a slow, small circle as the Drum turned.  Even from up
there I could see the tension in the set of his shoulders:  a system
stuck in a holding pattern, corroding through the long hours as fate
advanced with all the time in the world.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He looked up.  &quot;Ah.  It lives.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I fought the urge to retreat.  <I>Just a conversation, for God's
sake.  It's just two people talking.  People do it all the time
without your tools.  You can do this.  You can do this.</I></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<I>Just try</I>.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
So I forced one foot after another down the stairs, weight and
apprehension rising in lockstep.  I tried to read Cunningham's
topology through the haze.  Maybe I saw a facade, only microns deep.
Maybe he would welcome almost any distraction, even if he wouldn't
admit it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

&quot;How are you doing?&quot;  he asked as I reached the deck.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I shrugged.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Hand all better, I see.&quot;</P>

&quot;No thanks to you.&quot;

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I'd tried to stop that from coming out.  Really.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Cunningham struck a cigarette.  &quot;Actually, I <I>was</I> the one
who fixed you up.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;You also sat there and watched while he took me apart.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I wasn't even there.&quot;  And then, after a moment:  &quot;But
you may be right.  I might very well have sat it out in any event.
Amanda and the Gang <I>did</I> try to intervene on your behalf, from
what I hear.  Didn't do a lot of good for anyone.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;So you wouldn't even try.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Would you, if the sitution were reversed?  Go up unarmed
against a vampire?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I said nothing.  Cunningham regarded me for a long moment, dragging
on his cigarette.   &quot;He really got to you, didn't he?&quot; he
said at last.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;You're wrong,&quot;  I said.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Mmmm.&quot;  He seemed to consider the proposition.  &quot;What
word would you prefer, then?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I <I>observe</I>.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;That you do.  Some might even call it <I>surveillance</I>.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I-I read body language.&quot;  Hoping that that was all
he was talking about.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;It's a matter of degree and you know it.  Even in a crowd
there's a certain expectation of privacy.  People aren't prepared to
have their minds read off every twitch of the eyeball.&quot;  He
stabbed at the air with his cigarette.  &quot;And you.  You're a
shapeshifter.  You present a different face to every one of us, and
I'll wager none of them is real.  The <I>real</I> you, if it even
exists, is invisible...&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Something knotted below my diaphragm.  &quot;Who isn't?  Who
doesn't-try to fit in, who doesn't want to get along?   There's
nothing <I>malicious</I> about that.  I'm a synthesist, for God's
sake!  I <I>never</I> manipulate the variables.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Well you see, that's the problem.  It's not just <I>variables</I>
you're manipulating.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Smoke writhed between us.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;But I guess you can't really understand that, can you.&quot;
He stood and waved a hand.  ConSensus windows imploded at his side.
&quot;Not your fault, really.  You can't blame someone for the way
they're wired.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Give me a fucking break,&quot; I snarled.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
His dead face showed nothing.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
That, too, had slipped out before I could stop it-and after
that came the flood:  &quot;You put so much <I>fucking </I>stock in
that.  You and your <I>empathy</I>.  And maybe I <I>am</I> just some
kind of imposter but most people would swear I'd worn their very
souls.  I don't <I>need</I> that shit, you don't have to <I>feel</I>
motives to deduce them, it's better if you <I>can't</I>, it keeps
you-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Dispassionate?&quot; Cunningham smiled faintly.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Maybe your <I>empathy</I>'s just a comforting lie, you ever
think of that?  Maybe you <I>think </I>you know how the other person
feels but you're only feeling <I>yourself</I>, maybe you're even
worse than me.  Or maybe we're all just guessing.  Maybe the only
difference is that I don't lie to myself about it.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Do they look the way you imagined?&quot; he asked.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;What?  What are you talking about?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;The scramblers.  <I>Multijointed arms from a central mass</I>.
Sounds rather similar to me.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He'd been into Szpindel's archives.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I-Not really,&quot; I said.  &quot;The arms are
more-flexible, in real life.  More segmented.  And I never
really got a look at the body.  What does that have to do with-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Close, though, wasn't it?  Same size, same general body plan.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;So <I>what</I>?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Why didn't you report it?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;I did.  Isaac said it was just TMS.  From <I>Rorschach</I>.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;You saw them before <I>Rorschach</I>.  Or at least,&quot; he
continued, &quot;you saw <I>something</I> that scared you into
blowing your cover, back when you were spying on Isaac and Michelle.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
My rage dissipated like air through a breach.  &quot;They-they
knew?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Only Isaac, I think.  And it kept it between it and the logs.
I suspect it didn't want to interfere with your <I>noninterference</I>
protocols-although I'll wager that was the last time you ever
caught the two of them in private, yes?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I didn't say anything.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Did you think the official observer was somehow exempt from
observation?&quot; Cunningham asked after a while.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;No,&quot; I said softly.  &quot;I suppose not.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He nodded.  &quot;Have you seen any since?  I'm not talking about
run-of-the-mill TMS hallucinations.  I mean scramblers.  Have you
hallucinated any since you actually saw one in the flesh, since you
<I>knew</I> what they looked like?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I thought about it.  &quot;No.&quot;
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He shook his head, some new opinion confirmed.  &quot;You really are
something, Keeton, you know that?  You don't lie to yourself?  Even
now, you don't know what you know.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;You <I>figured it out</I>.  From <I>Rorschach</I>'s
architecture, probably-form follows function, yes?  Somehow you
pieced together a fairly good idea of what a scrambler looked like
before anyone ever laid eyes on them.  Or at least-&quot;  He
drew a breath; his cigarette flared like an LED- &quot;part of
you did.  Some collection of unconscious modules working their asses
off on your behalf.  But they can't show their work, can they?  You
don't have conscious access to those levels.  So one part of the
brain tries to tell another any way it can.  Passes notes under the
table.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Blindsight,&quot; I murmered.  <I>You just get a feeling of
where to reach...</I></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;More like schizophrenia, except you saw pictures instead of
hearing voices.  You saw <I>pictures</I>.  And you <I>still</I>
didn't understand.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I blinked.  &quot;But how would I-I mean-&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;What did you think, that <I>Theseus </I>was haunted?  That the
scramblers were communing with you telepathically?  What you do-it
<I>matters</I>, Keeton.  They told you you were nothing but their
stenographer and they hammered all those layers of hands-off
passivity into you but you just had to take some initiative anyway,
didn't you?  Had to work the problem on your own.  The only thing you
couldn't do was admit it to yourself.&quot;  Cunningham shook his
head.  &quot;Siri Keeton.  See what they've done to you.&quot;

I found the Gang floating in the center of the darkened observation

I looked around.  Not much to see.  Faraday mesh coated the inside of
the dome like a gray film, dimming and graining the view beyond.  Ben
hung like a black malignancy across half the sky.  I could make out a
dozen dim contrails against vague bands of cloud, in reds so deep
they bordered on black.  The sun winked past James's shoulder, <I>our</I>
sun, a bright dot that diffracted into faint splintered rainbows when
I moved my head.  That was pretty much it:  starlight didn't
penetrate the mesh, nor did the larger, dimmer particles of the
accretion belt.  The myriad dim pinpoints of shovelnosed machinery
were lost utterly.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

&quot;Shitty view,&quot; I remarked.  <I>Theseus</I> could have
projected crisp first-person vistas across the dome in an instant,
more real than real.</P>

Imagine that you encounter a signal.  It is structured, and dense
with information.  It meets all the criteria of an intelligent
transmission.  Evolution and experience offer a variety of paths to
follow, branch-points in the flowcharts that handle such input.
Sometimes these signals come from conspecifics who have useful
information to share, whose lives you'll defend according to the
rules of kin selection.  Sometimes they come from competitors or
predators or other inimical entities that must be avoided or
destroyed; in those cases, the information may prove of significant
tactical value.  Some signals may even arise from entities which,
while not kin, can still serve as allies or symbionts in mutually
beneficial pursuits.  You can derive appropriate responses for any of
these eventualities, and many others.</P>

&quot;Only if Jukka's right.  He may not be.&quot;  It was James
again, still quietly resisting, still unwilling to concede a point
that even her other selves had accepted.  I could see why.  Because
if Sarasti was right,  scramblers were the <I>norm</I>:  evolution
across the universe was nothing but the endless proliferation of
automatic, organized complexity, a vast arid Turing machine full of
self-replicating machinery forever unaware of its own existence.  And
we-we were the flukes and the fossils.  We were the flightless
birds lauding our own mastery over some remote island while serpents
and carnivores washed up on our shores.  Susan James could not bring
herself to concede that point-because Susan James, her multiple
lives built on the faith that communication resolves all conflict,
would then be forced to admit the lie.  If Sarasti was right, there
was no hope of reconciliation.</P>

A memory rose into my mind and stuck there:  a man in motion, head
bent, mouth twisted into an unrelenting grimace.  His eyes focused on
one foot, then the other.  His legs moved stiffly, carefully.  His
arms moved not at all.  He lurched like a zombie in thrall to rigor
mortis.</P>

I knew what it was.  Proprioreceptive polyneuropathy, a case study
I'd encountered in ConSensus back before Szpindel had died.  This was
what Pag had once compared me to; a man who had lost his mind.  Only
self-awareness remained.  Deprived of the unconscious sense and
subroutines he had always taken for granted, he'd had to focus on
each and every step across the room.  His body no longer knew where
its limbs were or what they were doing.  To move at all, to even
remain upright, he had to bear constant witness.</P>

Alarms chased us aft.  We launched ourselves down the spine through
the bridge, through the crypt, past hatches and crawlspaces, fleeing
the surface for any refuge with more than a hand's-breadth between
skin and sky.  Burrowing.  ConSensus followed us back, its windows

Down on the turning deck Bates erupted from the head, tactical
windows swirling like ballroom dancers around her.  Our own window
came to rest on the Commons bulkhead.  The hab expanded across that
display like a cheap optical illusion:  both swelling and shrinking
in our sights, that smooth surface billowing towards us while
collapsing in on itself.  It took me a moment to reconcile the
contradiction:  something had kicked the hab hard from its far side,
sent it careening toward us in a slow, majestic tumble.  Something
had <I>opened</I> the hab, spilled its atmosphere and left its
elastic skin drawing in on itself like a deflating balloon.  The
impact site swung into view as we watched, a scorched flaccid mouth

Our guns were firing.  They shot nonconducting slugs that would not
be turned aside by electromagnetic trickery-invisibly dark and
distant to human eyes but I saw them through the tactical crosshairs
of the firing robots, watched them sew twin dotted blackbodied arcs
across the heavens.  The streams converged as the guns tracked their
targets, closed on two attenuate throwing stars fleeing spread-eagled
through the void, their faces turned to <I>Rorschach</I> like flowers

But those shredded pieces kept falling, and suddenly the ground

across <I>Rorschach</I>'s hull like an orgy of snakes, naked to
space.  Some linked arms, one to another to another, built squirming
vertebral daisy-chains anchored at one end.  They lifted from the
hull, waved through the radioactive vacuum like fronds of articulated
kelp, reaching-grasping-</P>

Neither Bates nor her machines were stupid.  They targeted the
interlinked scramblers as ruthlessly as they'd gone after the
escapees, and with a much higher total score.   But there were simply
too many targets, too many fragments snatched in passing.  Twice I
saw dismembered bits of Stretch and Clench caught by their brethren.

This side of <I>Theseus</I> faced away from Big Ben, away from the

distant stars, hard and cold and unwinking.  A single, marginally
brighter one, shining yellow, still so very far away.  Any scant
comfort I might have taken from that sight was lost when the sun went
out for the briefest instant:  a tumbling piece of rock, perhaps.  Or

gently through the opening, turned.  <I>Theseus</I>' carapace curved
away from me in all directions.  Towards the prow, the sealed
observation blister rose above the horizon like a gunmetal sunrise.
Further aft a tattered snowdrift peeked across the hull: the edge of
the broken labhab.</P>

And past it all, close enough to touch, the endless dark cloudscape
of Big Ben:  a great roiling wall extending to some flat distant

dark and endless shades of gray-but dim, sullen redness teased
the corner of my eye when I looked away.</P>

crevice, a scorched and jagged tear in the fabric that folded back at
his touch.  Struts, broken panels, dead robot arms tangled through

Suddenly Bates and Sarasti were shouting in my helmet.  I tried to
brake.  My stupid useless legs kicked against vacuum, obeying some
ancient brainstem override from a time when all monsters were
earthbound, but by the time I remembered to use my trigger finger the
labhab was already looming before me.  <I>Rorschach</I> reared up
behind it in the near distance, vast and malign.  Dim green auroras
writhed across its twisted surface like sheet lightning.  <I>Mouths
</I>opened and closed by the hundreds, viscous as bubbling volcanic
mud, any one of them large enough to swallow <I>Theseus</I> whole.  I
barely noticed the flicker of motion just ahead of me, the silent
eruption of dark mass from the collapsed inflatable.  By the time
Cunningham caught my eye he was already on his way, backlit against
the ghastly corpselight flickering on <I>Rorschach</I>'s skin.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I thought I saw him waving, but I was wrong.  It was only the
scrambler wrapped around his body like a desperate lover, moving his
arm back and forth while it ran the thrust pistol tethered to his
wrist.  <I>Bye-bye</I>, that arm seemed to say, <I>and fuck you,
Keeton</I>.</P>

<I>Rorschach</I>'s mouths snapped shut at once, as though holding a

I have no idea whether the scrambler made it back home with its
hard-won prize.  There was so much lost distance to make up, even if
the emplacements didn't pick it off en route.  Cunningham's pistol
might have run out of fuel.  And who knew how long those creatures
could survive in vacuum anyway?   Maybe there'd been no real hope of
success, maybe that scrambler was dead from the moment it had gambled
on staying behind.  I never found out.  It had dwindled and vanished
from my sight long before <I>Rorschach</I> dove beneath the clouds
and disappeared in turn.

There had always been three, of course.  Stretch, and Clench<SPAN LANG="en-CA">,
</SPAN>and the half-forgotten microwaved remains of a scrambler
killed by an uppity grunt-kept on ice next to its living
brethren, within easy reach of Cunningham's teleops.  I tried to
dredge half-glimpsed details from memory, after the fact:  had both
of those escapees been spheres, or had one been flattened along one
axis?  Had they thrashed, waved their limbs the way some panicky
human might with no ground beneath him?  Or had one, perhaps, coasted
lifeless and ballistic until our guns destroyed the evidence?</P>

At this point, it didn't really matter.  What mattered was that at

<I>Rorschach</I>'s parting shot had punched through the carapace at
the base of the spine.  It had just missed the ramscoop and the
telematter assembly.  It might have taken out Fab if it hadn't spent
so many joules burning through the carapace, but barring some
temporary pulse effects it left all critical systems pretty much
operational. All it had done was weaken <I>Theseus</I>' backbone
enough to make it snap in two should we ever burn hard enough to
break orbit.  The ship would be able to repair that damage, but not
in time.</P>

And now, its quarry disabled, <I>Rorschach</I> had vanished.  It had
everything it needed from us, for the moment at least.  It had
information:  all the experiences and insights encoded in the
salvaged limbs of its martyred spies.  If Stretch-or-Clench's gamble
had paid off it even had a specimen of its own now, which all things
considered we could hardly begrudge it.  And so now it lurked
invisibly in the depths, resting perhaps.  Recharging.

<I>Theseus</I> lost weight for the final round.  We shut down the
drum in a token attempt to reduce our vulnerable allotment of moving
parts.  The Gang of Four-uncommanded, unneeded, the very reason
for their existence ripped away-retreated into some inner
dialog to which other flesh was unwelcome.  She floated in the
observatory, her eyes closed as tightly as the leaded lids around
her.  I could not tell who was in control.</P>

So I watched.  Bates counted skimmers in one window-mass,
inertia, any of a dozen variables that would prove far too constant
should any of those shovelnosed missiles come at our throat.  They
had finally noticed us.  Their chaotic electron-dance was shifting
now, hundreds of thousands of colossal sledgehammers in sudden flux,
reweaving into some ominous dynamic that hadn't yet settled into
anything we could predict.</P>

In another window <I>Rorschach</I>'s vanishing act replayed on
endless loop:  a radar image receding deep into the maelstrom, fading
beneath gaseous teratonnes of radio static.  It might still be an
orbit, of sorts.  Judging by that last glimpsed trajectory <I>Rorschach</I>
might well be swinging around Ben's core now, passing through crushed
layers of methane and monoxide that would flatten <I>Theseus</I> into
smoke.  Maybe it didn't even stop there; maybe <I>Rorschach</I> could
pass unharmed even through those vaster, deeper pressures that made
iron and hydrogen run liquid.</P>

We didn't know.  We only knew that it would be back in a little under
two hours, assuming it maintained its trajectory and survived the
depths.  And of course, it <I>would</I> survive.  You can't kill the

A thumbnail inset caught my eye with a flash of color.  At my command
it grew into a swirling soap bubble, incongruously beautiful,  a
blue-shifted coruscating  rainbow of blown glass.  I didn't recognize
it for a moment:  Big Ben, rendered in some prismatic false-color
enhance I'd never seen before.  I grunted softly.</P>

&quot;Quadrochromatic palette,&quot; Bates told me.  &quot;Like what
a cat might see.  Or a vampire.&quot;  She managed a half-hearted
wave at the rainbow bubble.  &quot;Sarasti sees something like that
every time he looks outside.  If he ever looks outside.&quot;</P>

&quot;I don't think they parse sight like we do.&quot;  Bates opened
another window.  Mundane graphs and contour plots sprang from the

How long would it take an enemy tactician to discern Bates' mind
behind the actions of her troops on the battlefield?  How long before
the obvious logic came clear?  In any combat situation, this woman
would naturally draw the greatest amount of enemy fire:  take off the
head, kill the body.  But Amanda Bates wasn't just a head:  she was a

The news bloomed across ConSensus a few seconds before Bates called
it aloud:   Thirteen skimmers had not reappeared from behind Big Ben
on schedule.  Sixteen.  Twenty-eight.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
And counting.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Sarasti clicked to himself as he and Bates played catch-up.  Tactical
filled with luminous multicolored threads, a tangle of revised
projections as intricate as art.  The threads wrapped Ben like a
filamentous cocoon; <I>Theseus</I> was a naked speck in the middle
distance.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I expected any number of those lines to skewer us like needles
through a bug.  Surprisingly, none did; but the projections only
extended twenty-five hours into the future, and  were reliable for
only half that.  Not even Sarasti and the Captain could look so far
ahead with that many balls in the air.  It was something, though, the
faintest silver lining:  that all these high-speed behemoths couldn't
simply reach out and swat us without warning.  Evidently they still
had to ease into the curve.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
After <I>Rorschach</I>'s dive, I'd been starting to think the laws of
physics didn't apply.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The trajectories were close enough, though.  At least three skimmers
would be passing within a hundred kilometers on their next orbits.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Sarasti reached for his injector, the blood rising in his face.
&quot;Time to go.  We refit <I>Charybdis</I> while you're sulking.&quot;

</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
He held the hypo to his throat and shot up.  I stared at ConSensus,
caught by that bright shifting web like a moth by a streetlight.</P>

grabbed a convenient rung-and stopped.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The spine was alive with grunts, patrolling the airspace, standing
guard over the fab plants and shuttle 'locks, clinging like giant
insects to the rungs of unrolling spinal ladders.  Slowly, silently,
the spine itself was <I>stretching</I>.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
It could do that, I remembered.  Its corrugations flexed and relaxed
like muscle, it could  grow up to two hundred meters to accommodate
any late-breaking need for a bigger hanger or more lab space.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Or more infantry.  <I>Theseus</I> was increasing the size of the
battlefield.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Come.&quot;  The vampire turned aft.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Bates broke in from up front.  &quot;Something's happening.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
An emergency handpad, geckoed to the expanding bulkhead, slid past to
one side.  Sarasti grabbed it and tapped commands.  Bates' feed
appeared on the bulkhead:  a tiny chunk of Big Ben, an EM-enhanced
equatorial quadrant only a few thousand klicks on a side.   The
clouds boiled down there, a cyclonic knot of turbulence swirling
almost too fast for realtime.   The overlay described charged
particles, bound in a deep Parker spiral.  It spoke of great mass,
rising.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Sarasti clicked.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;DTI?&quot; Bates said.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Optical only.&quot; Sarasti took my arm and dragged me
effortlessly astern.  The display paced us along the bulkhead:  seven
skimmers shot from the clouds as I watched, a ragged circle of
scramjets screaming red-hot into space.  ConSensus plotted their
paths in an instant; luminous arcs rose around our ship like the bars
of a cage.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<I>Theseus</I> shuddered.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<I>We've been hit</I>, I thought.  Suddenly the spine's plodding
expansion cranked into overdrive; the pleated wall lurched and
accelerated, streaming past my outstretched fingers as the closed
hatch receded up ahead-</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The walls weren't moving at all.  We were <I>falling</I>, to the
sudden strident bleating of an alarm.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Something nearly yanked my arm from its socket: Sarasti had reached
out with one hand and caught a rung, reached with his other and
caught me before we'd both been flattened against the Fab plant.  We
dangled.  I must have weighed two hundred kilograms; the floor
shuddered ten meters below my feet.  The ship groaned around us.  The
spine filled with the screech of torquing metal.   Bates' grunts
clung to its walls with clawed feet.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I reached for the ladder.  The ladder pulled away:  the ship was
bending in the middle and <I>down </I>had started to climb the walls.
 Sarasti and I swung towards the center of the spine like a
daisy-chain pendulum.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;<I>Bates!  James!</I>&quot;  The vampire roared.  His grip on
my wrist trembled, slipping.  I strained for the ladder, swung,
caught it.

&quot;Susan James has barricaded herself in the bridge and shut down

offline for at least twenty-seven minutes.&quot;</P>

He dropped obliquely in a blur.  Aft and opposite, the bulkhead
waited to swat him like an insect.   In half a second both his legs
would be shattered, if the impact didn't kill him outright-</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
But suddenly we were weightless again, and Jukka
Sarasti-purple-faced, stiff-limbed- was foaming at the
mouth.</P>

<I>He's having a seizure</I>, I realized.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
 I released the ladder and pushed astern.  <I>Theseus</I> swung
lopsidedly around me.  Sarasti convulsed in mid-air; clicks and
hisses and choking sounds stuttered from his mouth.  His eyes were so
wide they seemed lidless.  His pupils were mirror-red pinpoints.  The
flesh twitched across his face as though trying to crawl off.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Ahead and behind, battlebots held their position and ignored us.</P>

&quot;<I>Bates</I>!&quot; I yelled up the spine.  &quot;We need

Angles, everywhere.  Seams on the shield plates.  Sharp shadows and
protrusions on the surface of every drone.  A two-by-three matrix of
insets, bordered in black, floating over the main ConSensus display:
two big interlinked crosses right in front of where Sarasti had been
hanging.</P>

&quot;<I>Bates</I>!&quot;  She should be linked into the grunts, they
should have leapt forward at the first sign of trouble.  They should
be dragging my commander to the infirmary by now.   They waited
stolid and immobile.  I stared at the nearest:  &quot;Bates, you
there?&quot;  And then-in case she wasn't-I spoke to the
grunt directly.  &quot;Are you autonomous?  <I>Do you take verbal
orders</I>?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
On all sides the robots watched; the Captain just laughed at me, its

shoulders.  He tumbled forward and sideways, hit the moving ConSensus
display dead center, bounced away up the spine.  I kicked off in his
wake-</P>

&quot;Captain!  Sarasti's down!&quot;  I kicked off the nearest

It wasn't even talking to me, I realized.  Maybe this wasn't the

public-service announcements.  Maybe <I>Theseus</I> had already been
lobotomized.  Maybe this was only her brain stem talking.</P>

I gave Sarasti another push.  The alarm bleated on.  The drum was
twenty meters ahead; BioMed was just the other side of that closed
hatch.  The hatch had been open before, I remembered.  Someone had
shut it in the last few minutes.  Fortunately <I>Theseus</I> had no
locks on her doors.</P>

No answer.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Not from ConSensus, anyway.  I heard a muted <I>hum</I> from behind,
saw the ominous shifting of shadows on the bulkhead just a moment too
late.  I turned in time to see one of the grunts raise a spiky
appendage-curved like a scimitar, needle-tipped-over
Sarasti's head.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I froze.  The metal proboscis withdrew, dark and slick.  Lateral
maxillipeds began nibbling at the base of Sarasti's skull.  His
pithed corpse wasn't thrashing now; it only trembled, a sack of
muscles and motor nerves awash in static.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

The lights went out again.  The alarm fell silent.  ConSensus
dwindled to a flickering doodle on the bulkhead and disappeared; I
saw something there in that last instant, and refused to process it.
I heard breath catch in my throat, felt angular monstrosities
advancing through the darkness.  Something flared directly ahead, a
bright brief staccato in the void.  I glimpsed curves and angles in
silhouette, <I>staggering</I>.  The buzzing crackle of shorting
circuitry.  Metal objects collided nearby, unseen.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
From behind the crinkle of the drum hatch, opening.  A sudden beam of
harsh chemical light hit me as I turned, lit the mechanical ranks
behind; they simultaneously unclamped from their anchorages and
floated free.  Their joints clicked in unison like an army stamping
to attention</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

&quot;You okay?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The chemlight shone from her forehead.  It turned the interior of the
spine into a high-contrast mosaic, all pale surfaces and sharp moving
shadows.  It spilled across the grunt that had killed Sarasti; the
robot bounced down the spine, suddenly, mysteriously inert.  The
light washed across Sarasti's body.  The corpse turned slowly on its
axis.  Spherical crimson beads emerged from its head like drops of
water from a leaky faucet.  They spread in a winding, widening trail,
spot-lit by Bates' headlamp:  a spiral arm of dark ruby suns.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

drones.  &quot;Optical line of sight.&quot;</P>

rogue.  I could barely even get it to self-destruct.&quot;  Her eyes
went briefly deep-focus; all down the spine the surviving drones

&quot;Lightning.  EMP.&quot;  Drones sailed down to Fab and the

Stuttering brightness on all sides.  The spinal lightstrips flickered

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I'd seen scramblers.  Hundreds of them, sailing naked through the

</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

Bates nodded.  &quot;Weapons.&quot;  Her eyes flickered to some
unseen distance for a moment.  &quot;First wave headed for the front
end.  Blister and forward lock, I think. Second wave's aft.&quot;
She shook her head.  &quot;Huh.  I would have done it the other way
around.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

&quot;Far?&quot;  Bates smiled faintly.  &quot;They're already on the
hull, Siri.  We're engaging.&quot;</P>

Her eyes stared past me, and widened.  She opened her mouth.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
A hand clamped on my shoulder from behind and spun me around.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Sarasti.  His dead eyes stared from a skull split like a spiked
melon.  Globules of coagulating blood clung to his hair and skin like
engorged ticks.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Go with him,&quot; Bates said.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Sarasti grunted and clicked.  There were no words.
</P>

&quot;What-&quot; I began.</P>

&quot;<I>Now.</I>  That's an order.&quot;  Bates turned back to the
hatch.  &quot;We'll cover you.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The shuttle.  &quot;You too.&quot;</P>

&quot;No.&quot;</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Can't leave yourself a back door, Keeton.  Defeats the whole
purpose.&quot;  She allowed herself a small, sad smile.  &quot;They've
breached.  Go.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
She was gone, fresh alarms rising in her wake.  Far towards the bow I
heard the crinkle of emergency bulkheads snapping shut.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Sarasti's undead carcass gurgled and pushed me down the spine.  Four
more grunts slid smoothly past and took up position behind us.  I
looked over my shoulder in time to see the vampire pull the handpad
from the wall.  But it wasn't Sarasti at all, of course.  It was the
Captain-whatever was left of the Captain, this far into the
fight-commandeering a peripheral interface for its own use.
The optical port sprouted conspicuously from the back of Sarasti's
neck, where the cable used to go in; I remembered the drone's
maxillipeds, chewing.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The sound of weapons fire and ricochets rose behind us.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The corpse typed one-handed as we moved.  I wondered briefly why it
just didn't <I>talk</I> before my gaze flickered back to the spike in
his brain:  Sarasti's speech centers must be mush.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Why did you kill him?&quot; I said.  A whole new alarm started
up, way back in the drum.  A sudden <I>breeze</I> tugged me backward
for a moment, dissipated in the next second with a distant clang.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The corpse held out the handpad, configured for keys and a text
display:  Seizng. Cldnt cntrl.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
We were at the shuttle locks.  Robot soldiers let us pass, their
attention elsewhere.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
U go, the Captain said.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Someone screamed in the distance.  Way off up the spine, the drum
hatch slammed shut; I turned and saw a pair of distant grunts welding
the seal.  They seemed to move faster now than they ever had before.
Maybe it was only my imagination.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The starboard shuttle lock slid back.  <I>Charybdis</I>' interior
lights winked on, spilling brightness into the passageway; the
spine's emergency lighting seemed even dimmer in contrast.  I peered
through the opening.  There was almost no cabin space left-just
a single open coffin jammed between coolant and fuel tanks and
massive retrofitted shockpads.  <I>Charybdis</I> had been refitted
for high-G and long distance.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
And me.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Sarasti's corpse urged me on from behind.  I turned and faced it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&quot;Was it <I>ever</I> him?&quot; I asked.</P>

&quot;<I>Tell me</I>.  Did he ever speak for himself?  Did he decide
<I>anything</I> on his own?  Were we ever following <I>his </I>orders,
or was it just you all along?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Sarasti's undead eyes stared glassy and uncomprehending.  His fingers
jerked on the handpad.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">

I let it strap me in and close the lid.  I lay there in the dark,
feeling my body lurch and sway as the shuttle slid into its launch
slot.  I withstood the sudden silence as the docking clamps let go,
the jerk of acceleration that spat me hard into the vacuum, the
ongoing thrust that pushed against my chest like a soft mountain.
Around me the shuttle trembled in the throes of a burn that far
exceeded its normative specs.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
My inlays came back online.  Suddenly I could see <I>outside</I> if I
wanted.  I could see what was happening behind me.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I chose not to, deliberately and fervently, and looked anyway.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<I>Theseus</I> was dwindling by then, even on tactical.  She listed
down the well, wobbling toward some enemy rendezvous that must have
been intentional, some last-second maneuver to get her payload as
close to target as possible.  <I>Rorschach</I> rose to meet her, its
gnarled spiky arms <I>uncoiling</I>, spreading as if in anticipation
of an embrace.  But it was the backdrop, not the players, that stole
the tableau:  the face of Big Ben roiling in my rearview, a seething
cyclonic backdrop filling the window.  Magnetic contours wound
spring-tight on the overlay; <I>Rorschach</I> was drawing all of
Ben's magnetosphere around itself like a bright swirling cloak,
twisting it into a concentrated knot that grew and brightened and
bulged outward...</P>

<I>Like a torsion flare from an L-class dwarf,</I> my commander had
said once, <I>but we should see anything big enough to generate that
effect and the sky's dark on that bearing.  IAU calls it a
statistical artefact.</I></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
As, in fact, it had been.  An impact splash perhaps, or the bright
brief bellow of some great energy source rebooting after a million
years of dormancy.  Much like this one:  a solar flare, with no sun
beneath it.  A magnetic cannon ten thousand times stronger than
nature gave it any right to be.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Both sides drew their weapons.  I don't know which fired first, or
even if it mattered:  how many tonnes of antimatter would it take to
match something that could squeeze the power of a sun from a gas ball
barely wider than Jupiter?  Was <I>Rorschach</I> also resigned to
defeat, had each side opted for a kamikaze strike on the other?</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I don't know.  Big Ben got in the way just minutes before the
explosion.  That's probably why I'm still alive.  Ben stood between
me and that burning light like a coin held against the sun.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<I>Theseus</I> sent everything it could, until the last microsecond.
Every recorded moment of hand-to-hand combat, every last countdown,
every last soul.  All the moves and all the vectors.  I have that
telemetry.  I can break it down into any number of shapes, continuous
or discrete.  I can transform the topology, rotate it and compress it
and serve it up in dialects that any ally might be able to use.
Perhaps Sarasti was right, perhaps some of it is vital.</P>

If only I wouldn't die in my sleep if I tried.  But living bodies
glitter with a lifetime's accumulation of embedded radioisotopes,
brilliant little shards that degrade cellular machinery at the
molecular level.  It's not usually a problem.  Living cells repair
the damage as fast as it occurs.  But my undead ones let those errors
accumulate over time, and the journey home takes so much longer than
the trip out:  I lie in stasis and <I>corrode</I>.  So the onboard
kick-starts me every now and then to give my flesh the chance to
stitch itself back together.</P>

Occasionally it talks to me, recites system stats, updates me on any
chatter from back home.  Mostly, though, it leaves me alone with my
thoughts and the machinery ticking away where my left hemisphere used
to be.  So I talk to myself, dictate history and opinion from real
hemisphere to synthetic one:  bright brief moments of awareness, long
years of oblivious decay between.  Maybe the whole exercise is
pointless from the start, maybe no one's even listening.

I got a letter from Dad today.  General delivery, he called it.  I

just threw it omnidirectionally into the ether and hoped it would
wash over me, wherever I was.</P>

Helen's dead.  Heaven-malfunctioned, apparently.  Or was
sabotaged.  Maybe the Realists finally pulled it off.  I doubt it,
though.  Dad seemed to think someone else was responsible.  He didn't
offer up any details.  Maybe he didn't know any.  He spoke uneasily
of increasing unrest back home.  Maybe someone leaked my communiqu-s
about <I>Rorschach</I>; maybe people drew the obvious conclusion when
our postcards stopped arriving.  They don't know how the story ended.
 The lack of closure must be driving them crazy.</P>

But I got the sense there was something else, something my father
didn't dare speak aloud.  Maybe it's just my imagination;  I thought
he even sounded troubled by the news that the birth rate was rising
again, which should be cause for celebration after a generation in
decline.  If my Chinese Room was still in proper working order I'd
<I>know</I>, I'd be able to parse it down to the punctuation.  But
Sarasti battered my tools and left them barely functional.  I'm as
blind now as any baseline.  All I have is uncertainty and suspicion,
and the creeping dread that even with my best tricks in tatters, I
might be reading him right.</P>

He also said he loved me.  He said he missed Helen, that she was
sorry for something she did before I was born, some indulgence or
omission that carried developmental consequences.  He rambled.  I
don't know what he was talking about.  So much power my father must

They played well.  I admit it freely.  Or maybe they just got lucky.
An accidental hiccough tickles Bates' grunt into firing on an unarmed

sewn in Susan's head.  I think it looked ahead and saw the uses to

deliberately provoking <I>Rorschach</I> to retaliation with that

though some might call it genocide it isn't really.  We did it to

<I>Blindsight</I> is my first novel-length foray into deep space-a
domain in which I have, shall we say, limited formal education.  In
that sense this book isn't far removed from my earlier novels:  but
whereas I may have not known much about deep sea ecology either, most
of you knew even less, and a doctorate in marine biology at least let
me fake it through the rifters trilogy.  <I>Blindsight</I>, however,
charts its course through a whole different kind of zero gee; this
made a trustworthy guide that much more important.   So first let me
thank Prof. Jaymie Matthews of the University of British Columbia:
astronomer, partygoer, and vital serial sieve for all the ideas I
threw at him.  Let me also thank Donald Simmons, aerospace engineer
and gratifyingly-cheap dinner date, who reviewed my specs for <I>Theseus</I>
(especially of the drive and the Drum), and gave me tips on radiation
and the shielding therefrom.  Both parties patiently filtered out my
more egregious boners.  (Which is not to say that none remain in this
book, only that those which do result from my negligence, not theirs.
 Or maybe just because the story called for them.)

David Hartwell, as always, was my editor and main point man at Evil
Empire HQ.  I suspect <I>Blindsight </I>was a tough haul for both of
us:  shitloads of essential theory threatened to overwhelm the story,
not to mention the problem of generating reader investment in a cast

The usual gang of fellow writers critiqued the first few chapters of
this book and sent me whimpering back to the drawing board:  Michael
Carr, Laurie Channer, Cory Doctorow, Rebecca Maines, David Nickle,
John McDaid, Steve Samenski, Rob Stauffer and the late Pat York.  All
offered valuable insights and criticisms at our annual island
getaway; Dave Nickle gets singled out for special mention thanks to
additional insights offered throughout the year, generally at ungodly
hours.  By the same token, Dave is exempted from the familiar
any-errors-are-entirely-mine schtick that we authors boilerplate onto
our Acknowledgements.  At least some of the mistakes contained herein
are probably Dave's fault.</P>

Profs. Dan Brooks and Deborah MacLennan, both of the University of
Toronto, provided the intellectual stimulation of an academic
environment without any of the political and bureaucratic bullshit
that usually goes along with it.  I am indebted to them for litres of
alcohol and hours of discussion on a number of the issues presented
herein, and for other things that are none of your fucking business.
Also in the too-diverse-to-itemise category, Andr- Breault
provided a west-coast refuge in which I completed the first draft.
Isaac Szpindel-the <I>real</I> one&shy;-  helped out, as
usual, with various neurophys details, and Susan James (who also
really exists, albeit in a slightly more coherent format) told me how
linguists might approach a First Contact scenario.  Lisa Beaton
pointed me to relevant papers in a forlorn attempt to atone for
whoring her soul to Big Pharma.  Laurie Channer acted as general
sounding board, and, well, put up with me.  For a while, anyway.
Thanks also to Karl Schroeder, with whom I batted around a number of
ideas in the arena of sentience-vs.-intelligence.  Parts of
<I>Blindsight</I> can be thought of as a rejoinder to arguments
presented in Karl's novel <I>Permanence</I>;  I disagree with his
reasoning at almost every step, and am still trying to figure out how
we arrived at the same general endpoint.</P>

I'm hardly the first author to take a stab at rationalising vampirism
in purely biological terms.  Richard Matheson did it before I was
born, and if the grapevine's right that damn Butler woman's latest
novel will be all over the same territory before you even read this.
I bet I'm the first to come up with the Crucifix Glitch to explain
the aversion to crosses, though- and once struck by that bit of
inspiration, everything else followed.</P>

Vampires were accidentally rediscovered when a form of experimental
gene therapy went curiously awry, kick-starting long-dormant genes in
an autistic child and provoking a series of (ultimately fatal)
physical and neurological changes.  The company responsible for this
discovery presented its findings after extensive follow-up studies on
inmates of the Texas penal system; a recording of that talk, complete
with visual aids, is available online<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A></SUP>;
curious readers with half an hour to kill are refered there for
details not only on vampire biology, but on the research, funding,
and &quot;ethical and political concerns&quot; regarding vampire
domestication (not to mention the ill-fated &quot;Taming Yesterday's
Nightmares For A Brighter Tomorrow&quot; campaign).  The following
(much briefer) synopsis restricts itself to a few biological
characteristics of the ancestral organism:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%">
<I>Homo sapiens vampiris</I> was a short-lived Human subspecies which
diverged from the ancestral line between 800,000 and 500,000 year BP.
 More gracile than either <I>neandertal</I> or <I>sapiens</I>,  gross
physical divergence from <I>sapiens</I> included slight elongation of
canines, mandibles, and long bones in service of an increasingly
predatory lifestyle.  Due to the relatively brief lifespan of this
lineage, these changes were not extensive and overlapped considerably
with conspecific allometries; differences become diagnostically
significant only at large sample sizes (N&gt;130).</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%"><A NAME="_RefF4"></A><A NAME="_Ref110222656"></A>
However, while virtually identical to modern humans in terms of gross
physical morphology, <I>vampiris</I> was radically divergent from
<I>sapiens</I> on the biochemical, neurological, and soft-tissue
levels.  The GI tract was foreshortened and secreted a distinct range
of enzymes more suited to a carnivorous diet.  Since cannibalism
carries with it a high risk of prionic infection<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A></SUP>,
the vampire immune system displayed great resistance to prion
diseases<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote3anc" HREF="#sdfootnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SUP>,
as well as to a variety of helminth and anasakid parasites.  <I>Vampiris</I>
hearing and vision were superior to that of <I>sapiens</I>; vampire
retinas were quadrochromatic (containing four types of cones,
compared to only three among baseline humans); the fourth cone type,
common to nocturnal predators ranging from cats to snakes, was tuned
to near-infrared.  Vampire grey matter was &quot;underconnected&quot;
compared to Human norms due to a relative lack of interstitial white
matter; this forced isolated cortical modules to become
self-contained and hypereffective, leading to omnisavantic
pattern-matching and analytical skills<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote4anc" HREF="#sdfootnote4sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A></SUP>.

</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%">
Virtually all of these adaptations are cascade effects that-
while resulting from a variety of proximate causes- can
ultimately be traced back to a paracentric inversion mutation on the
Xq21.3 block of the X-chromosome<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote5anc" HREF="#sdfootnote5sym"><SUP>5</SUP></A></SUP>.
 This resulted in  functional changes to genes coding for
protocadherins (proteins that play a critical role in brain and
central nervous system development).  While this provoked radical
neurological and behavioral changes, significant <I>physical </I>changes
were limited to soft tissue and microstructures that do not
fossilise.   This, coupled with extremely low numbers of vampire even
at peak population levels (existing as they did at the tip of the
trophic pyramid) explains their virtual absence from the fossil
record.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%">
Significant deleterious effects also resulted from this cascade.  For
example, vampires lost the ability to code for <FONT FACE="Symbol, serif">&#61541;</FONT>-Protocadherin
Y, whose genes are found exclusively on the hominid Y chromosome<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote6anc" HREF="#sdfootnote6sym"><SUP>6</SUP></A></SUP>.
 Unable to synthesise this vital protein themselves, vampires had to
obtain it from their food.  Human prey thus comprised an essential
component of their diet, but a relatively slow-breeding one (a unique
situation, since prey usually outproduce their predators by at least
an order of magnitude).  Normally this dynamic would be utterly
unsustainable:  vampires would predate humans to extinction, and then
die off themselves for lack of essential nutrients.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%">
Extended periods of lungfish-like dormancy<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote7anc" HREF="#sdfootnote7sym"><SUP>7</SUP></A></SUP>
(the so-called &quot;undead&quot; state)-and the consequent
drastic reduction in vampire energetic needs- developed as a
means of redressing this imbalance.   To this end vampires produced
elevated levels of endogenous Ala-(D) Leuenkephalin (a mammalian
hibernation-inducing peptide<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote8anc" HREF="#sdfootnote8sym"><SUP>8</SUP></A></SUP>)
and dobutamine, which strengthens the heart muscle during periods on
inactivity<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote9anc" HREF="#sdfootnote9sym"><SUP>9</SUP></A></SUP>.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%">
Another deleterious cascade effect was the so-called &quot;Crucifix
Glitch&quot;- a cross-wiring of normally-distinct receptor
arrays in the visual cortex<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote10anc" HREF="#sdfootnote10sym"><SUP>10</SUP></A></SUP>,
resulting in <I>grand mal</I>-like feedback siezures whenever the
arrays processing vertical and horizontal stimuli fired
simultaneously across a sufficiently large arc of the visual field.
Since intersecting right angles are virtually nonexistent in nature,
natural selection did not weed out the Glitch until <I>H. sapiens
sapiens</I> developed Euclidean architecture; by then, the trait had
become fixed across <I>H. sapiens vampiris</I> via genetic drift,
and-suddenly denied access to its prey-the entire
subspecies went extinct shortly after the dawn of recorded history.</P>

You'll have noticed that Jukka Sarasti, like all reconstructed
vampires, sometimes <I>clicked</I> to himself when thinking.  This is
thought to hail from an ancestral language, which was hardwired into
a click-speech mode more than 50,000 years BP.  Click-based speech is

For example, the invisibility trick of that young, dumb scrambler-

 Since then, a variety of researchers have made objects pop in and
out of the visual field unnoticed, conducted conversations with

This is the heart of the whole damn exercise.  Let's get the biggies
out of the way first.  Metzinger's <I>Being No One<SUP>20</SUP></I>
is the toughest book I've ever read (and there are still significant
chunks of it I haven't), but it also contains some of the most
mindblowing ideas I've encountered in fact or fiction.  Most authors
are shameless bait-and-switchers when it comes to the nature of
consciousness.  Pinker calls his book <I>How the Mind Works</I><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote98anc" HREF="#sdfootnote98sym"><SUP>98</SUP></A></SUP>,
then admits on page one that &quot;We don't understand how the mind
works&quot;.  Koch (the guy who coined the term &quot;zombie agents&quot;)
writes <I>The Quest for Consciousness:  A Neurobiological Approach</I><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote99anc" HREF="#sdfootnote99sym"><SUP>99</SUP></A></SUP>,
in which he sheepishly sidesteps the whole issue of why neural
activity should result in any kind of subjective awareness
whatsoever.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%">
Towering above such pussies, Metzinger takes the bull by the balls.
His &quot;World-zero&quot; hypothesis not only explains the
subjective sense of self, but also why such an illusory first-person
narrator would be an emergent property of certain cognitive systems
in the first place.  I have no idea whether he's right- the
man's way beyond me- but at least he addressed the <I>real</I>
question that keeps us staring at the ceiling at three a.m., long
after the last roach is spent.  Many of the syndromes and maladies
dropped into <I>Blindsight </I>I first encountered in Metzinger's
book.  Any uncited claims or statements in this subsection probably
hail from that source.</P>

If they don't, then maybe they hail from Wegner's <I>The Illusion of
Conscious Will<SUP>21</SUP></I> instead.  Less ambitious, far more
accessible, Wegner's book doesn't so much deal with the nature of
<I>consciousness</I> as it does with the nature of <I>free will</I>,
which Wegner thumbnails as &quot;our mind's way of estimating what it
thinks it did.&quot;.  Wegner presents his own list of syndromes and
maladies, all of which reinforce the mind-boggling sense of what
fragile and subvertible machines we are.  And of course, Oliver
Saks<SUP>22</SUP> was sending us memos from the edge of consciousness
long before consciousness even had a bandwagon to jump on.</P>

suggests that while great apes and adult Humans are sentient, young

But beneath the unthreatening, superficial question of what
consciousness <I>is</I> floats the more functional question of what
it's good for.  <I>Blindsight </I>plays with that issue at length,
and I won't reiterate points already made.  Suffice to say that, at
least under routine conditions, consciousness does little beyond
taking memos from the vastly richer subconcious environment,
rubber-stamping them, and taking the credit for itself.  In fact, the
nonconscious mind usually works so well on its own that it actually
employs a gatekeeper in the anterious cingulate cortex to do nothing
but <I>prevent</I> the conscious self from interfering in daily
operations<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote112anc" HREF="#sdfootnote112sym"><SUP>112</SUP></A></SUP><SUP>,

Sentience isn't even necessary to develop a &quot;theory of mind&quot;.
 That might seem completely counterintuitive:  how could you learn to
recognise that other individuals are autonomous agents, with their
own interests and agendas, if you weren't even aware of your own?
But there's no contradiction, and no call for consciousness.  It is
entirely possible to track the intentions of others without being the
slightest bit self-reflective<SUP>107</SUP>.  Norretranders declared
outright that &quot;Consciousness is a fraud&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote115anc" HREF="#sdfootnote115sym"><SUP>115</SUP></A></SUP>.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%">
Art might be a bit of an exception.  Aesthetics seem to require some
level of self-awareness-in fact, the evolution of aethestics
might even be what got the whole sentience ball rolling in the first
place.  When music is so beautiful if makes you shiver, that's the
reward circuitry in your limbic system kicking in:  the same
circuitry that rewards you for fucking an attractive partner or
gorging on sucrose<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote116anc" HREF="#sdfootnote116sym"><SUP>116</SUP></A></SUP>.
 It's a hack, in other words; your brain has learned how to get the
reward without actually earning it through increased fitness<SUP>98</SUP>.
 It feels good, and it fulfills us, and it makes life worth living.
But it also turns us inward and distracts us.  Those rats back in the
sixties, the ones that learned to stimulate their own pleasure
centers by pressing a lever:  remember them?  They pressed those
levers with such addictive zeal that they forgot to eat.  They
starved to death.  I've no doubt they died happy, but they <I>died</I>.
 Without issue.  Their fitness went to Zero.</P>

Aesthetics.  Sentience.  Extinction.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%">
And that brings us to the final question, lurking way down in the
anoxic zone:  the question of what consciousness <I>costs</I>.
Compared to nonconscious processing, self-awareness is slow and
expensive<SUP>112</SUP>. (The premise of a separate, faster entity
lurking at the base of our brains to take over in emergencies is
based on studies by, among others, Joe LeDoux of New York
University<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote117anc" HREF="#sdfootnote117sym"><SUP>117</SUP></A></SUP>&shy;<SUP>,
</SUP><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote118anc" HREF="#sdfootnote118sym"><SUP>118</SUP></A></SUP>).
  By way of comparison, consider the complex, lightning-fast
calculations of savantes; those abilities are noncognitive<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote119anc" HREF="#sdfootnote119sym"><SUP>119</SUP></A></SUP>,
and there is evidence that they owe their superfunctionality not to
any overarching integration of mental processes but due to relative
neurological <I>fragmentation<SUP>4</SUP></I>.  Even if sentient and
nonsentient processes were equally efficient, the conscious awareness
of visceral stimuli-by its very nature- distracts the
individual from other threats and opportunities in its environment.
(I was quite proud of myself for that insight.   You'll understand
how peeved I was to discover that Wegner had already made a similar
point back in 1994<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote120anc" HREF="#sdfootnote120sym"><SUP>120</SUP></A></SUP>.)
The cost of high intelligence has even been demonstrated by
experiments in which smart fruit flies lose out to dumb ones when
competing for food<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote121anc" HREF="#sdfootnote121sym"><SUP>121</SUP></A></SUP>,
possibly because the metabolic demands of learning and memory leave
less energy for foraging.  No, I haven't forgotten that I've just
spent a whole book arguing that intelligence and sentience are
different things.  But this is still a relevant experiment, because
one thing both attributes do have in common is that they are
metabolically <I>expensive</I>.  (The difference is, in at least some
cases intelligence is worth the price.  What's the survival value of
obsessing on a sunset?)
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%">
While a number of people have pointed out the various costs and
drawbacks of sentience, few if any have taken the next step and
wondered out loud if the whole damn thing isn't more trouble than
it's worth.  Of course it is, people assume; otherwise natural
selection would have weeded it out long ago. And they're probably
right.  I hope they are.  <I>Blindsight</I> is a thought experiment,
a game of <I>Just suppose</I> and <I>What if</I>.  Nothing more.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%">
On the other hand, the dodos and the Steller sea cows could have used
exactly the same argument to prove their own superiority, a thousand
years ago: <I> if we're so unfit, why haven't we gone extinct?</I>
Why?  Because natural selection takes time, and luck plays a role.
The biggest boys on the block at any given time aren't necessarily
the fittest, or the most efficient, and the game isn't over.  The
game is <I>never</I> over; there's no finish line this side of heat
death.  And so, neither can there be any winners.  There are only
those who haven't yet lost.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:justify; font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%">
Cunningham's stats about self-recognition in primates:  those too are
real.  Chimpanzees have a higher brain-to-body ratio than
orangutans<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote122anc" HREF="#sdfootnote122sym"><SUP>122</SUP></A></SUP>,
yet orangs consistently recognise themselves in mirrors while chimps
do so only half the time<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote123anc" HREF="#sdfootnote123sym"><SUP>123</SUP></A></SUP>.
 Similarly, those nonhuman species with the most sophisticated
language skills are a variety of birds and monkeys-not the
presumably &quot;more sentient&quot; great apes who are our closest
relatives<SUP>81, </SUP><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote124anc" HREF="#sdfootnote124sym"><SUP>124</SUP></A></SUP>.
 If you squint,  facts like these suggest that sentience might almost
be a phase, something that orangutans haven't yet grown out of but
which their more-advanced chimpanzee cousins are beginning to.
(Gorillas don't self-recognise in mirrors.  Perhaps they've already
grown out of sentience, or perhaps they never grew into it.)</P>
