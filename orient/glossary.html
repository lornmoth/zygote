<h3 id="free-genome-movement">Free Genome Movement</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Gene patents represent the foremost impediment to personalized medicine.” - Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. 2016</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Movement fighting for the freedom to perform genome research, test one’s own genome and make use of refined genomics with impunity and without charge. Proponents believe gene patenting limits genomic advancement and causing great harm to the public by making scientific research costly, forcing peer review to the para-academic underground and requiring testers to hide pressing diagnostic results from patients, preventing application for those who need it. Most prominently lead by the Free Genome Foundation (FGF), founded by Rick Carlson and James Watson, other historical players include <a href="http://www.etopiamedia.net/empnn/pages/cpt-emnn/cpt-emnn99-5551212.html">Californians for Universal Voluntary Individual Genomic Sequencing</a> and the <a href="http://personalgenome.net">$0 Genomics Project</a>.</p>
<p>Largely spurred by the post-millenial policies of megacorporation Myriad Genetics, whose aggressively enforced monopoly over parts of the human genome made full genome tests illegal and refusal to contribute their database or methodology prevented verifiability of their predictions. In 2013, Myriad was forced to relinquish their patents when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-398_1b7d.pdf">open-sourcing natural gene sequences</a> - yet in doing so, allowed patents on refined genomes.</p>
