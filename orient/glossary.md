# Glossary

<div class="no-column">
## A

### Accelerationism
Accelerating the progress of a system so that it's inherent contradictions more rapdily reach the point of unsustainability, resulting in breakdown or paradigm shift.

### Aethernet

### Agalmic Economy
The digital information economy that surrounds info-products. Agalmics has grown exponentially as the commercial productspace is increasingly reduced to serializable information atoms. 

### Ailiens
Xenomorphic entities formed out out artificial intelligence algorithms. The first encountered by mankind was the autonomous corporate automata.

### Apocalypticism
General 
Alias: Eschaton, Kali Yuga.

### Archailect
ascended post-singularity intelligence that has grown vastly beyond even the Transapient level, ruler of their own discreet micro-universe. They exist as distributed intelligences in networks of planet-sized computer brains; their subroutines are themselves sentient, making an "archai" an individual and a civilization at the same time.

### Assassination Market
Crowdfunded bounty autonomous hyperrobust assassination market. Any recorded individual can be listed, and any user can contribute funds to a pool that will be delivered to whomever offers an exact prediction of their day of death. Predictions are anonymous and encrypted, with the decryption key transmitted by the winning predictor only after the death occurs; if the guess is correct, the funds are distributed. Most markets require a certain buy-in fee to submit a production, algorithmically determined to discourage mass random guessing.

### Autonomous Corporate Automata

### Authorialism  
Ideology espousing a belief in a centralized authorship protocol that presides over the distribution and consumption of created content. Dominant set of the surface web belief-matrix.  
	*see: [belief-matrix](#belief-matrix), [internet gentrification](#internet-gentrification), [surface web](#surface-web)*

### Autocapitalism  
Capitalist flows considered to be an autonomous supra-entity dominating all narrative organization in the Mostmodern era.

	*see: [apocalypticism](#apocalypticism), [mostmodernism](#mostmodernism), [synergy](#synergy)*

### Chaos Magick 		
Engineering synchronicity through willed manipulation of internal thoughtmatrices.

> - Borganist slogan

Virtual-social consensus standard of evidence relying on the convergence of multiple, independent sources; response to personal consilience becoming outmoded by deepfakery.

### Cryptomnesia 
memory returns without it being recognised as such by the subject, who believes it is something new and original; others memory believed to be ones own


### Cybershamanism			

## D

### Daemon	
	
### Darkweb

	*see: authorialism, hyperforum, internet gentrification, pictolinguism, psuedoillegal, referentialism*

### Dead Pool
Autonomous predictions market for regulating speculative bets on the deaths of individual peoples. Controversial due to enabling a legally unprovable assasination market: a normal bet would be betting for or against an individual dying by this year or month; an assasination request would have someone place a large sum of money on an individual not dying on an exact date set to accept only one taker at $1; the assassin would accept the bet and perform the action. There is no way to legally prove he did not just win a very lucky bet. Due to the hyperrobusticity of DAO's, they exist undeterred. Due to a quirk of corporate legalislation, dead pools also cover corporations with death defined as Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 

### Decentralized Autonomous Corporation

	See: bifurcation, hyperstition, meandric

## E

### Economics 2.0
Posthuman economic theory. Incomprehensible without cognitive reprogramming. apparently replaces the
 single-indirection layer of conventional money, and the
 multiple-indirection mappings of options trades, with some kind of
 insanely baroque object-relational framework based on the
 parameterized desires and subjective experiential values of the
 players

### Egoist

### Emotion Overloading

### Exocortex

### Experientialism

## F
### Fact-space
An entity of any kind is a glob in fact-space. The world – the collection of all thoughts and objects – is a pattern spread out through fact-space.

### Fractal Collapse 	
Late-stage cultural process following an Industry dominated narrative organization that results in a marked rise of disillusion and terror relating to one’s cultural self-identity. The collective thought world shrinks down to smaller and smaller splinter-groups until wider meaning is lost and distinct civilization ends, leaving behind only an ultra-large framework of technology. 
	See: apocalypticism, decentralization

### Free Genome Movement
>"Gene patents represent the foremost impediment to personalized medicine." 
>- Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. 2016

Movement fighting for the freedom to perform genome research, test one's own genome and make use of refined genomics with impunity and without charge. Proponents believe gene patenting limits genomic advancement and causing great harm to the public by making scientific research costly, forcing peer review to the para-academic underground and requiring  testers to hide pressing diagnostic results from patients, preventing application for those who need it. Most prominently lead by the Free Genome Foundation (FGF), founded by Rick Carlson and James Watson, other historical players include [Californians for Universal Voluntary Individual Genomic Sequencing](http://www.etopiamedia.net/empnn/pages/cpt-emnn/cpt-emnn99-5551212.html) and the [$0 Genomics Project](http://personalgenome.net).

Largely spurred by the post-millenial policies of megacorporation Myriad Genetics, whose aggressively enforced monopoly over parts of the human genome made full genome tests illegal and refusal to contribute their database or methodology prevented verifiability of their predictions. In 2013, Myriad was forced to relinquish their patents when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of [open-sourcing natural gene sequences](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-398_1b7d.pdf) - yet in doing so, allowed patents on refined genomes. 

*see: [human_genome_project](#human-genome-project), [megacorporation](#megacorporation)*

*see: longue durée, prosopography, syncretism*

### Lucidity

### Lyapunov time		
Chaotic timescale after a dynamical system has moved beyond the bounds of precise, probabilistic predictability. Unlike usual physicomechanical time, of an essentially reversible quantity (static axis adding a fourth dimension to three-dimensional space), “Lyapunov time” flows irreversibly, in one direction, and, consequently, consists not of a once-and-for-all defined trajectory (in four-dimensional space), but of “events,” completely unpredictable movements, which are arbitrary, accidental, irregular. 
	see: bifurcation, quantum hypothesis

### Trans Time-collapse
>If every transition forms a new quantum timeline at the moment of its announcement, a fork in belief-history, what does the increasing prevalence of "desistance", of detransitioners, entail? Timelines recklessly forked and merged. Are we not observing engineered time-collapse?
>Mass Psuedodysphoria and its Consequences

Transphobic conspiracy theory that believes mass marketed social transitioning ("psuedodysphoria" aka transtrenders) is an attempt to cause quantum time-collapse under the presumption that biopic retconning are historical revisionist forks generating new quantum timelines, which are recklessly post-merged with detransitioned in resulting in repeated quantum overrides.

### Trolling
Arbitrage on an individual's discrepancy between ego and reality, with the goal of producing emotional overloading.

### Turing Oracle: 
A method for determining whether a given program ever halts. There is no algorithm to do this. Access to a Turing Oracle is near-godlike computing power. For instance, one could prove Fermat's Last Theorem (or almost any other theorem) by writing a program that tries all possible x, y, z, and n until it finds a solution of x^n+y^n=z^n, then asking the Turing Oracle whether the program will ever find a solution. It would also factor large integers, fold proteins, etc.

## U

### Ultimate Ensemblism
The view that our external physical reality is a mathematical structure. That is, the physical universe is not merely described by mathematics, but is mathematics (specifically, a mathematical structure). Mathematical existence equals physical existence, and all structures that exist mathematically exist physically as well. Observers, including humans, are "self-aware substructures (SASs)".

Alias: Mathematical Universe Hypothesis

### Ultrarobust
Long term, self sustaining, independent of state or capital.

### Unhumanism
Nihilistic posthumanist philosophy founded in response to the discoveries of postanthropobiology.

	Name?
I literally do not think these people have even the most limited form of agency, that of even being considered independent actors in a complex system capable of unpredictable behavior. They are the direct product of a combination of (1) genetic predestiny, (2) psychological trauma, (3) environmental conditions and (4) belief-matrices formed predominately by internalized thoughtviruses. Their every move and word could be calculated /years/ into the future with a computer probably realistically feasible within 10 years, because their diminished mental capacities and corrupted souls has precluded them the ability to cultivate complex, adaptive thought.
