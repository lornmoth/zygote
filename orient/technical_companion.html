<h3 id="endogenous-retroviruses">Endogenous Retroviruses</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Are these viruses a part of us? They definitely are.” - David Haig</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Retroviruses reach the host’s genome to be copied and passed on to daughter cells for the life of the host. Endogenous retroviruses (ERV) effect the sperm or egg cell, passing onto every cell in subsequent generations. ERV might enter a symbiotic relationship with the host when their mutations contribute adaptive functions.</p>
<p>Retroviruses mechanism of action is to enter a cell, use the enzyme reverse transcriptase to turn its RNA into DNA, enter the nucleus and inserts its DNA into the genome. If the cell it infects is a sperm or egg cell, it will become endogenous and pass down to descendants.</p>
<p>30% of all protein adaptations since humans’ divergence with chimpanzees have been driven by viruses. Adaptations occur three times as frequently in virus-interacting proteins compared with other proteins. such as why closely-related species have evolved different machinery to perform identical cellular functions, like DNA replication or the production of membranes.</p>
<p>Viruses are a dominant driver of protein adaptation in mammals: https://elifesciences.org/articles/12469</p>

<h3 id="finite-nature-hypothesis-edward-fredkin">Finite Nature Hypothesis (Edward Fredkin)</h3>
<p>The Fredkin finite nature hypothesis states that ultimately all quantities of physics, including space and time, are discrete and finite. All measurable physical quantities arise from some Planck scale substrate for information processing. Also, the amount of information in any small volume of spacetime will be finite and equal to a small number of possibilities. https://web.archive.org/web/20130829040406/http://64.78.31.152/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/finite_nature.pdf</p>
<h3 id="fractal-ca-cosmology">Fractal CA Cosmology:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>The world can be resolved into digital bits, with each bit made of smaller bits.</li>
<li>These bits form a fractal pattern in fact-space.</li>
<li>The pattern behaves like a cellular automaton.</li>
<li>The pattern is inconceivably large in size and dimensions.</li>
<li>Although the world started very simply, its computation is irreducibly complex.</li>
</ol>
<p>So what is reality, one more time? An incompressible compuation by a fractal CA of inconceivable dimensions. And where is this huge computation taking place? Everywhere; it’s what we’re made of. - Rudy Rucker: The Five Levels of Mathematical Reality</p>
<h3 id="multiverse-hypothesis">Multiverse Hypothesis</h3>
<p>Stephen Wolfram. In Chapter 9 of A New Kind of Science,[3] Stephen Wolfram presents an outline of a multiverse automaton. Below the Planck scale, there is an informational substrate that allows the build-up of time, space, and energy by means of an updating parameter. The updating parameter for the multiverse is analogous to time via a mathematical isomorphism, but the updating parameter involves a decomposition across alternate universes. The informational substrate consists of network nodes that can simulate random network models and Feynman path integrals. In physical reality, both energy and spacetime are secondary features. The most fundamental feature of reality is signal propagation caused by an updating parameter acting upon network nodes. The multiverse automaton has a model consisting of informational substrate, an updating parameter, a few simple rules, and a method for deriving all of quantum field theory and general relativity theory, The totally finite nature of the model implies the existence of weird, alternate-universe forces that might, or might not, be too small for empirical detection.</p>

<h3 id="abstract-machine">Abstract Machine</h3>
<p>In continental philosophy, that which constructs a new real, rather than representing one. Alias: diagrammatic machine.</p>
<h3 id="assemblage">Assemblage</h3>
<p>‘The diagrammatic or abstract machine does not function to represent, even something real, but rather constructs a real that is yet to come, a new type of reality… the abstract machine connects a language to the semantic and pragmatic contents of statements, to collective assemblages of enunciation, to a whole micropolitics of the social field… the map of relations between forces, a map of destiny, or intensity, which…acts as a non-unifying immanent cause which is coextensive with the whole social field. The abstract machine is like the cause of the concrete assemblages that execute its relations; and these relations take place ‘not above’ but within the very tissue of the assemblages they produce’</p>
<h3 id="gödelian-anti-mechanism">Gödelian Anti-Mechanism</h3>
<p>Gödelian arguments claim that a system of human mathematicians (or some idealization of human mathematicians) is both consistent and powerful enough to recognize its own consistency. Since this is impossible for a Turing machine, the Gödelian concludes that human reasoning must be non-mechanical.</p>
<p>However, the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that actual human reasoning is inconsistent; that any consistent “idealized version” H of human reasoning would logically be forced to adopt a healthy but counter-intuitive open-minded skepticism about the consistency of H (otherwise H is provably inconsistent); and that Gödel’s theorems do not lead to any valid argument against mechanism.[3][4][5] This consensus that Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are doomed to failure is laid out strongly in Artificial Intelligence: “any attempt to utilize (Gödel’s incompleteness results) to attack the computationalist thesis is bound to be illegitimate, since these results are quite consistent with the computationalist thesis.”"</p>
<p>Gödel uses the incompleteness theorem to arrive at the following disjunction: (a) the human mind is not a consistent finite machine, or (b) there exist Diophantine equations for which it cannot decide whether solutions exist. Gödel finds (b) implausible, and thus seems to have believed the human mind was not equivalent to a finite machine, i.e., its power exceeded that of any finite machine. He recognized that this was only a conjecture, since one could never disprove (b). Yet he considered the disjunctive conclusion to be a “certain fact”.</p>

<h3 id="anthropic-principle">Anthropic Principle</h3>
<h3 id="the-omega-point-cosmology">The Omega Point cosmology</h3>
<p>The Omega Point is a term Tipler uses to describe a cosmological state in the distant proper-time future of the universe that he maintains is required by the known physical laws. According to this cosmology, it is required for the known laws of physics to be mutually consistent that intelligent life take over all matter in the universe and eventually force its collapse. During that collapse, the computational capacity of the universe diverges to infinity and environments emulated with that computational capacity last for an infinite duration as the universe attains a solitary-point cosmological singularity. This singularity is Tipler’s Omega Point.[6] With computational resources diverging to infinity, Tipler states that a society far in the future would be able to resurrect the dead by emulating all alternative universes of our universe from its start at the Big Bang.[7] Tipler identifies the Omega Point with God, since, in his view, the Omega Point has all the properties of God, claimed by most of the traditional religions Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the Universe, and, once it comes into existence, will never die out.[10]</p>
<p>The strong anthropic principle (SAP), as explained by John D. Barrow and Frank Tipler, states that this is all the case because the universe is in some sense compelled to eventually have conscious and sapient life emerge within it. Some critics of the SAP argue in favor of a weak anthropic principle (WAP) similar to the one defined by Brandon Carter, which states that the universe’s ostensible fine tuning is the result of selection bias (specifically survivor bias): i.e., only in a universe capable of eventually supporting life will there be living beings capable of observing and reflecting on the matter</p>
