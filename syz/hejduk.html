House<br>
John Hejduk (-)</u></p>
<p>
<br>  I
<br>  A woman lives in the house; she has taken its name.
<br>  A house knows who loves it.
<br>  An empty house is one that metamorphoses into vacant space.
<br>  The breath of a house is the sound of voices within.
<br>  I sense I am leaving you.
<br>  I loved you in/a/way.
<br>  Forever is everfor.
<br>  Maze Gods the soul.
<br>  Maze guards the body.
<br>  The house is a nocturnal thing; this is seen from the out side
<br>    when the lights are turned on.
<br>  The house is like a black cat at night, only a silhouette.
<br>  A house roams at night when its occupants sleep.
<br>  Night dreams are accelerated in fixed rooms.
<br>  Day dreams blank out light.
<br>  The yawning of a house comes from the excessive sound of
<br>    its inhabitants.
<br>  The house likes the weaver; it remembers its early construction.
<br>  The sister of a house is its garden.
<br>  When a house is sad its glazing clouds over and there is no
<br>    movement of air
<br>  The house never forgets the sound of its original occupants.
<br>  A house's ghosts stay inside; if they leave and go outside they
<br>    disappear.
<br>  A house is only afraid of gods, fire, wind, and silence.
<br>  A house's blood is the moving people within when they still stop.
<br>  A house is seen crying when it sheds its rainwaters.
<br>  The gods are jealous of the house because the house cannot fly.
<br>  The stairs of a house are mysterious because they move up and
<br>    down at the same time.
<br>  Snow is female, icicles male.
<br>  A house fears the wind and is afraid of trees.
<br>  A house carries its own weight, also the sorrows within.
<br>  Lightning is the house's direct connection to the heavens.
<br>
<br>  God gave man two houses, his body and his soul.
<br>  All souls implode when a woman dies; it is then when man's heart
<br>    disappears. The sanctuary of a house is the closed room.
<br>  Man gave names to rooms, God gave the space.
<br>  The sound of a house is its distant lament.
<br>  The furniture of a house is the silent witness of man.
<br>  The house doorknob inverts time.
<br>  The aroma of a room is defined by woman's presence and by her
<br>    absence.
<br>  A house's shadow proves its dark two-dimensionality.
<br>  A house's calendar is its internal falling leaves.
<br>  Crawling vines on a house hint at its agelessness.
<br>  When a woman's dress falls on the floor of a room God hears it.
<br>  The birth of a house is from a female.
<br>  To dance in a house is a forbidden fruit.
<br>  A house awaits letters.
<br>  A house's windows yearn for the sun.
<br>  Frosted windows are the drawing boards of a house.
<br>  A porch of a house mediates between nature and building.
<br>  A house lies in state during wars.
<br>  Flowered wallpaper within a house makes the house feel an
<br>    unease.
<br>  Locked doors within a house mean either joy or horror.
<br>  The stone floors of a house in winter send a chill to all extremities.
<br>  The thoughts of a private house should be kept secret.
<br>  Heat rises in a house in order to return to mother sun.
<br>  God named house.
<br>  The soul of a house is its soul.
<br>  The awnings of a house indicate a house's sorrow.
<br>  Moonlight within a house is the darkest light imaginable.
<br>  A house wakes up in the morning and smiles at the bird feeder.
<br>  Night stars are an indication that it is snowing in the universe.
<br>  A red down makes the house drowsy.
<br>  A house plays with the lake through its reflections.
