The collective thought world shrinks down to smaller and smaller splinter-groups until wider meaning is lost and distinct civilization ends, leaving behind only an ultra-large framework of technology. 
	See: apocalypticism, decentralization

### Free Genome Movement
>"Gene patents represent the foremost impediment to personalized medicine." - Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. 2016

Movement fighting for the freedom to perform genome research, test one's own genome and make use of refined genomics with impunity and without charge. Proponents believe gene patenting limits genomic advancement and causing great harm to the public by making scientific research costly, forcing peer review to the para-academic underground and requiring  testers to hide pressing diagnostic results from patients, preventing application for those who need it. Most prominently lead by the Free Genome Foundation (FGF), founded by Rick Carlson and James Watson, other historical players include [Californians for Universal Voluntary Individual Genomic Sequencing](http://www.etopiamedia.net/empnn/pages/cpt-emnn/cpt-emnn99-5551212.html) and the [$0 Genomics Project](http://personalgenome.net). Largely spurred by the post-millenial policies of Myriad Genetics, whose aggressively enforced monopoly over parts of the human genome made full genome tests illegal and refusal to contribute their database or methodology prevented verifiability of their predictions. In 2013, Myriad was forced to relinquish their patents when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of [open-sourcing natural gene sequences](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-398_1b7d.pdf) - yet in doing so, allowed patents on refined genomes.

### Lucidity

### Lyapunov time		
Chaotic timescale after a dynamical system has moved beyond the bounds of precise, probabilistic predictability. Unlike usual physicomechanical time, of an essentially reversible quantity (static axis adding a fourth dimension to three-dimensional space), “Lyapunov time” flows irreversibly, in one direction, and, consequently, consists not of a once-and-for-all defined trajectory (in four-dimensional space), but of “events,” completely unpredictable movements, which are arbitrary, accidental, irregular. 
	see: bifurcation, quantum hypothesis

### Pictolinguism		
Iconographic dialect that speaks to a priori knowledge coded as such to speak only to those who already know. Sufficiently evocative imagery can access an individual’s thoughtworld.
	see: pareidolic noise

### Planetization

### Traditional Method
In contrast to the outmoded Scientific Method, received new attention as it proved effect in artificial intelligence development, which effectively simulates the traditional method on a rapid time-scale. Alias: Heuristic Science.

### Turing Oracle: 
A method for determining whether a given program ever halts. There is no algorithm to do this. Access to a Turing Oracle is near-godlike computing power. For instance, one could prove Fermat's Last Theorem (or almost any other theorem) by writing a program that tries all possible x, y, z, and n until it finds a solution of x^n+y^n=z^n, then asking the Turing Oracle whether the program will ever find a solution. It would also factor large integers, fold proteins, etc.

## U

### Ultimate Ensemblism
The view that our external physical reality is a mathematical structure. That is, the physical universe is not merely described by mathematics, but is mathematics (specifically, a mathematical structure). Mathematical existence equals physical existence, and all structures that exist mathematically exist physically as well. Observers, including humans, are "self-aware substructures (SASs)". In any mathematical structure complex enough to contain such substructures, they "will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically 'real' world".
