## Teleomechanism (Thermoteleos)
The distinction between 'mechanical' and 'teleological' has been familiar since Kant; between a fully mechanistic, quantitative science of Nature and a teleological, qualitative approach to living beings, namely 'organisms' understood as purposive or at least functional entities.

## Ensemble axiom
The ensemble axiom proposes that cooperation within an ensemble permits extreme simplification of the parts and enhances the operation of the ensemble.
Ensemble: mass action with single-role actors, e.g. DDOS


## Metachronal rhythm
A metachronal rhythm or metachronal wave refers to wavy movements produced by the sequential action (as opposed to synchronized) of structures such as cilia, segments of worms or legs. These movements produce the appearance of a travelling wave. A Mexican wave is a large scale example of a metachronal wave. 

## Beta movement
Beta movement is an optical illusion, first described by Max Wertheimer in 1912,[1] whereby a series of static images on a screen creates the illusion of a smoothly flowing scene. This occurs when the frame rate is greater than 10 to 12 separate images per second (The phi phenomenon is the optical illusion of perceiving a series of still images, when viewed in rapid succession, as continuous motion.)

## Gestaltism
Gestalt psychology or gestaltism is an attempt to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world. The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self-organizing tendencies.

This principle maintains that when the human mind (perceptual system) forms a percept or "gestalt", the whole has a reality of its own, independent of the parts. The original famous phrase of Gestalt psychologist Kurt Koffka, "the whole is something else than the sum of its parts"[2] is often incorrectly translated[3] as "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts", and thus used when explaining gestalt theory, and further incorrectly applied to systems theory.[4] Koffka did not like the translation. He firmly corrected students who replaced "other" with "greater". "This is not a principle of addition" he said.[5] The whole has an independent existence.

Virtual gestalt, the virtual experience independent from but just as experientially real as reality.


## Artificial Cosmogenesis
 We advocate that computer simulations are needed to address two key cosmological issues. First, the robustness of the emergence of complexity, which boils down to ask: "what would remain the same if the tape of the universe were replayed?" Second, the much debated fine-tuning issue, which requires to answer the question: "are complex universes rare or common in the space of possible universes?" We argue that computer simulations are indispensable tools to address those two issues scientifically. We first discuss definitions of possible universes and of possible cosmic outcomes - such as atoms, stars, life or intelligence. 

 This leads us to introduce a generalized Drake-like equation, the Cosmic Evolution Equation. It is a modular and conceptual framework to define research agendas in computational cosmology. We outline some studies of alternative complex universes. However, such studies are still in their infancy, and they can be fruitfully developed within a new kind of cosmology, heavily supported by computer simulations, Artificial Cosmogenesis. The Appendix [section 9] provides argumentative maps of the paper's main thesis.

# Computing

### Metacomputation
Models of computation that can produce outputs that are not Turing compatible, such as solving the Entscheidungsproblem. Alias: hypercomputation, post-computer.

### Nooscope
Instrument that records the noosphere and all its changes.
	see: noosphere

### Wireworld
Turing-complete cellular automaton ruleset uniquely suited to simulating electronic logic elements.

### Weizsäcker's Ur-alternatives
theory of archetypal objects), first publicized in his book The Unity of Nature (1971),[16][17] further developed through the 1990s,[18][19][20] is a kind of digital physics as it axiomatically constructs quantum physics from the distinction between empirically observable, binary alternatives

### Tellurian 			
Of the Earth. Alias: Chthonic. 
see: Tellurian Omega

### Tellurian Omega
Final stage of history when the earth is consumed by the dying, expanding sun. Tellurian meaning of the earth, chtonic.



### Synchronization of Chaos 	
Phenomenon occurring when two, or more, dissipative chaotic systems are coupled and produce a higher-level order.

### Synergy			
Interaction of multiple agents to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects. 
See: catallaxy, emergence, self-organization


--

### Abstract Machines
In the computation theory, an abstracted computer to complex equations or algorithms, such as a Turing machine.

In continental philosophy, that which constructs a new real, rather than representing one. Alias: diagrammatic machine.


### Assemblage
'The diagrammatic or abstract machine does not function to represent, even something real, but rather constructs a real that is yet to come, a new type of reality… the abstract machine connects a language to the semantic and pragmatic contents of statements, to collective assemblages of enunciation, to a whole micropolitics of the social field… the map of relations between forces, a map of destiny, or intensity, which…acts as a non-unifying immanent cause which is coextensive with the whole social field. The abstract machine is like the cause of the concrete assemblages that execute its relations; and these relations take place ‘not above’ but within the very tissue of the assemblages they produce'


--

### Action
A spontaneously organized group activity that produces any kind of measurable effect.

---

Quantum Environment –  a timeline, also known as a dimension, parallel reality or event scenario.


Quantum Displacement –  temporary movement onto an alternate time line.

Retro-Causal –  an event or condition caused via time travel to the past. In retro-causation, an effect precedes its cause in the future. Example: A boy time travels from the future to the past and is photographed there. During the time between the making of the photograph and the making of the trip to the past via time travel, the photograph exists retro-causally.
