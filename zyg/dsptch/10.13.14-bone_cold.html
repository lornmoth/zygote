Everything gets just a little wet. No one mentions it. It stays two days before leaving as quietly as it came. Maybe off to Denver?</p>

<p>Haven&#39;t gotten a good night&#39;s sleep since the voodoo incident. The cicada&#39;s used to cry all night long, but when fall came, you could find their dead bodies amongst the leaves. Now there&#39;s only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180924134354/https://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/october/nasa-study-finds-earth-s-ocean-abyss-has-not-warmed/" title="Earthâ€™s Ocean Abyss Has Not Warmed">the howl of the wind.</a> It's true the train goes right over my building, but you can&#39;t hear it - you feel it. What you do hear is the ambulance sirens, speeding through to somewhere in the zipcode almost nightly. Always headed South - never see them come back.
</p>

<p>Haven&#39;t seen the Sun in four days now. It doesn&#39;t simply leave the days cold, or dark, but in a vacuum. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180922202117/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY3TLpC11TI" title="Move D - Kriek - Animals">Your movements are more precise in the cold.</a> You can feel it in your bones. The Blood Moon visited again. Did you guys see it? It&#39;s about all we&#39;ve got left.

<p>Haven&#39;t set foot inside an automobile in six weeks. Six weeks. I miss cars. Sweaty leather upholstery, cupholders filled with pennies, backseat gliding 70+ MPH. I pray every time I step onto the Light Rail. It&#39;s dangerous. Rickety. Everybody&#39;s got a story of fate just almost placing them on a train-to-be-derailed.</p>

<p>The lines shut down one by one as the night drags on. The Red Line doesn&#39;t. They call it the Blood Line. Goes straight through to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225143744/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eGJL682JPA&app=desktop" title="Robert Armani - Ghost">Bronzeville</a> - get offered every vice on your ride down.
</p>

<p>Clutch your pocketblade tight under your coat, the rabble&#39;s come out to play.</p>
