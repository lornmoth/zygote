<p><u><strong>Subject: Report From The Singing House</strong></u></p>
<p>Comrades,</p>
<p>I know I have been speaking to you both individually via "the Pipeline" but I thought it was about time to send a proper report. I am sitting in my C-20 class I can see the tip of Caroline's hair bun from here, something I haven't seen since the "major breakdown" of our relationship that sent me spiraling downwards. Today, this Ex-lover is nothing but a cold distant memory of what once was. I felt a mild melancholy as I watched her walk away, but I also noted that her body appeared stubby, her face is oily and the Misfits patch on her cardigan was fucking pedestrian, but I fear my friends that this is only a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Last Friday I made contact with Johnny, an O.T.I.S. student five years my senior. I was connected to him by William. He picked me up around 9, I felt immediately comfortable with him as I felt the warm leather seats of his Prius. We discussed how "fucking expensive" rent is and how a few months ago he was living in his Prius after a split with his live in girlfriend (she signed the lease, Ha!) We drove over to an unmarked building in Beverly Hills, we took surface streets, I still don't know why. Upon arriving I saw crude oil paintings of sphincters and decapitated women. "This is very good" I said to Johnny. I went to the back to get a beer, a man out there told me that I had a very strong stance. I wanted to jerk off right there.</p>
<p>I met an extremely tan woman with a black jumper you could see her breasts partially for the jumper was unbuttoned quite a bit. Her skin made her teeth look extremely white. I drifted my eyes to her company, a woman with curly hair which I ignored and now a woman, brown hair, a mild unibrow that had been plucked partially. Her shirt was a transparent black, you could see in full detail her body, thin, the first body I had been attracted to since I had met Caroline. A shy one, I'll continue to talk of her later, if I can remember her name.</p>
<p>
"Where's the after party" I hear Johnny say to someone,<br>
"Santa Monica but go to the other show first"<br><br>
I am tired of writing about this night, it was beautiful, I made good connections and now have an "in" to society, friendship, lovers.</p>

<p>I've been wearing black dress shoes with a two inch heel. As I walk down the streets of Los Angeles you can hear the crack of my feet into the pavement, a beautiful and violent march forward. I've become more concerned with my physical appearance, a close shave every morning using warm water to raise the hairs, use a hot towel and place it on your face and neck for about 45 seconds for best results. A small black comb in my back pocket to keep things in order throughout the day. I am trying to pride myself on my genetics even though, according to eugenics, I am inferior. Mussolini didn't think so. </p><p>I have been walking confidently around the halls, trying my best to put this into habit, so that even in weakness I have a strong vibrant walk, enough to make the ground shake. Looking at cult leaders and members of the Process Church for more advice on being persuasive and confident.</p>
<p>
I am adapting the philosophy, mind over body over soul, one must learn self discipline in order to be free of the hardships of the pedestrian man. Do not follow your leaders, become better than them.</p><p>YOUR WILL BE DONE, DO NOT SUBMIT TO ANYONE BUT YOURSELF, LOVE UNDER WILL.
</p><p>You have the technology at your disposal.</p>
<p>Your friend, always with love,</p>
<p>T</p>
