<p><strong>8/21/14</strong></p>
<p>I’m not sure what it is, maybe the extreme humidity or just something in the water, but my virility is off the wall over here. When flaccid, my cock remains bulbous and dangles down past my already fully-loose scrotum. There’s a thin sheen of sweat that covers both balls and dick at all times, and when I lay down sideways and examine I can see the elasticity of the skin the covers my main shaft. When erect, I’m over 7 inches, practically 8 inches if I measure liberally. I’ve been masturbating by bringing my pelvis up to the rim of my sink and swinging my scrotum over so its lies flat against the cold porcelain interior, this completely amplifies sensation and from there my erect cock juts outward, taking up the whole diameter of the sink. I’ll emit minor grunts and give myself long, meticulous strokes until I launch around 5-6 huge loads of thick, milky white semen. Even once I’ve finished, I don’t feel the Drain I used to feel back home.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the strangest experiences I’ve had so far was leaving Mos Burger yesterday. I got to the automatic glass doors and noticed a glaucous coating over the landscape outside. I assumed it was just me looking through dirty glass but once I stepped outside the haze and blur became even more potent. Once it reaches a certain time of day over here, there’s a greenish “murk” that enshrouds everything.</p>
<p>Some of the best looking people I’ve seen here are the lower working-class that dangle out of their vehicles or squat on the cracked ground chain smoking. There’s something extremely “sharp” about them. They wear loose-fitting, untraceable clothing and all have jet-black hair and cavernous faces with leathery skin. </p>
<p>I met T.K.at “Woobar” the other night, where the lighting palette consisted of strictly blues, reds and purples. He knew a worker at the bar and we were immediately seated outside across from each other at a small table by the pool. We sat on top of enormous phosphorescent white seats that looked like hard-shell beanbags. T.K. was immediately granted a pack of cigarettes and a lighter in a ceremonious manner. Each item was given to him by a different person and they all bowed and never made eye contact. We got a brand of beer called “Taiwan Beer,” which he said I would be drinking a lot of. T.K. lives with the booker or promoter (can’t remember) of a club called Korner. It’s genuinely underneath the ground and he described it as a dark corridor. His friend M. from England, half-english & half-chinese, met us at the bar and wasn’t as good-looking as I expected. T.K. told me a humorous tale of railing Ketamine at Woobar and repeatedly falling off of his chair. Molly is available too, both drugs are supposedly cheap here. No sign of Adderall, or any straight amphetamine. We all got in a taxi, glided through the neon streets, ate some cheap teppanyaki and drank more beer at my place. They were impressed by my music. I’m looking to make more night moves like this. </p>

<p>Upcoming events:
<br>- “Adult Game Club” at Korner this Saturday. Lineup: Kolette, Petstov, Naja. "Dress code: Heavy"
<br>
- All night set by DVS1 at Korner, an unclear event in the mountains the next day, then back to Korner that night where T.K. is part of the DJ lineup. Molly ingestion.</p>

<p>Currents supplements:
<br>Healthforce “Vitamineral Green” (2 scoops a day)
<br>Healthforce “ZeoForce” (1120 mg pure micro-reduced clinoptilolite mineral concentrate with the zeolite “cage” supposedly still in tact)
<br>Healthforce “Digestion Enhancement Enzymes” (before any meal, I have them in my backpack)
<br>Healthforce “Liver Rescue 5+” (2 capsules a day, maybe more depending on the night before)</p>

<p><strong>8/27/14</strong></p>
<p>Was picked up right off the Xinyi line yesterday and travelled to the coast in <a href="https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/2752082/original_b8c65a58f119b9bb40c089d7fd715cd0.png">Yilan County</a> with Kitty, Vera & Sandy: three older and extremely unattractive Taiwanese women. English levels: intermediate. Kitty, a stout 34 year old with an enormous tattoo of a medieval shield brandishing the name “Robert” on her forearm, drove us in her golden Mercedes "<a href="https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/2752083/original_ab45552343b344a1221c533d184dde7c.jpg">300E</a>” as (really good) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180922202850/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQH60Z6QKjw" title="Samingad (紀曉君) - Puyuma Homeland (故鄉普悠瑪)">Taiwanese music</a> blasted through the speakers. Vera, 24, with huge breasts, false teeth and reptilian facial features, sat in front of me while Sandy, also 24, with her black-pored face and burly, unshaven legs, sat right beside me. Their afflictions of the flesh bypassed my standard notion of the ‘Foreign male/Taiwanese girl’ relationship and resulted in what felt like a more authentic interaction. There was no Energy spent thinking over sensual temptations, which would have been disgusting. And yet beyond this their skin cried of innocence, and the more I listened to the tonalities of their Mandarin, heard their laughter, or allowed them to observe what they called my “marble” eyes, the more I felt genuine spirits in all three of them. Once we left Taipei, the one hour highway drive to the coast really "heated my senses" and revealed the more tropical zones of Taiwan. A single mountain-tunnel would last over ten minutes, the perpetual stream of fluorescents beaming above until we emerged on the other end to dense canopies and overlooking temples. We arrived on the beach in Yilan with its soft, black sand and green, hilly backdrop. The water was actually hot and it soothed the cockroach bite on my lower calf. If you glanced passed the quay made of black stones there was a sense of the derelict dredging, whereas a look to the shore evoked the original Kavalan in their aboriginal squats.</p>

<p>We left the beach to head for Luodong Township, driving along expanses of highway past the Mitsubishi Savrins and through smaller industrial sectors where you can recognize the chronological flow of gaslight, electricity, telephone, running water, and MRT. The aged four-fold interaction of prisons, freight yards, ice plants and officer barracks. Luodong ran amok with scooters & cars bumper to bumper in the neon ambience. Buddhist ceremonies were occurring next door to bone-setting clinics and mechanic shops. The night market overflowed with hoards of people. Golden 50NT coins exchanged hands for <a href="https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/2752091/original_1f1296d49f05214659a1870bca737294.jpg" title="Fish Balls">fish balls</a>, bagged fried chicken, and lamb skewers. The three girls and I seized a small metal table with tiny metal stools next to a booth where we were served pig intestine, pig belly, and minced pork with chunks of ginger, clusters of steamed yam leaves, and rice bowls. Overall, the whole day, including a gas “pitch-in", cost me around 500NT (~$17).
</p>

<p>By the end of the night I had agreed to teach Vera and Kitty’s friend english in a clandestine language-lab that I will establish. Still not sure if I will follow through with it though. This may lead to a wider network and some hotter “initiates.” Vera agreed to 1400NT per two hour session.</p>

<p>———</p>

<p>I arrived at T.K.’s apartment (top floor, no elevator, vaulted door) last Saturday to go to Korner, where I met S.T.: a looming, six foot tall, bald Australian who works in marketing for English schools in Taiwan. He works in Taipei, gets paid an Australian salary, and holds his money in a Singaporean bank account. He lived in Japan for two years (more fun, he says) before coming to Taipei (better place to live, he says). By 11:30 PM we arrived at Korner, the only sign of it from above being a black stairwell leading down as well as the distinct crowd of foreigners and Taiwanese youth clustering above. Before going in and beneath a freeway column I met V.M., an “experimental filmmaker” who embraced me for my equal knowledge of Edward Yang, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Wong Kar-Wai & Christopher Doyle, Leos Carax and Peter Greenaway. He claims that Taipei is a good place to make movies and also has some good theaters. T.K.’s roommate, J., an aerodynamic looking Asian with black hair tied tautly behind his head in a bun, and the one in charge of Korner, was also there.</p>

<p>We descended into the sweat-box to the pounding of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180922203120/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXBwL0HqNtc">Ancient Methods</a>. The entrance fee was 200NT (~$7) which included a drink. From memory, the whole interior was completely black except for a tree that seemed to sprout out of the wall. Aside from a few tables near the entrance and a fully-stocked bar the only thing besides the dance-floor & gothically-caged DJ area was a table with one candle at the far end of the club. I remember nearly vomiting from a poisonous whisky shot, black girls, girls from Canada, one of the DJs (<a href="https://twitter.com/petstov/status/497022702738092032/photo/1">Petstov</a>) being enormous and having no shirt, and the frequent mention of “green ecstasy” (although it never showed its face). From here, the night blurs and becomes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180922203346/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iFHoI1rYJA">harder to explain.</a></p>

<p>Korner is place that can grant itself to local myth. It deserves a brutal death or police-shutdown. It is not quite at the point yet of defining its existence through the specificities of "a scene" and it is definitely not the deepest or darkest a club can get. But what is good is its humility, it is a humble and intimate place with good people and good music. The carnal-drive is pushed to the background yet sex is clearly still obtainable in more crystallized and alien forms. I met an Australian man who, wearing a tribal bone-necklace and on Ketamine, told me that he worked in the “fashion industry” and “music” and lived in Tokyo. I heard that apparently there is a group of three men and one woman in Taipei who go under the moniker “The Vampires”. They ingest massive amounts of drugs and consistently host orgies. Their record for staying up is seven days.</p>

<p>T.K. and I emerged from Korner around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180922203622/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3fAcVEyDNI">3:00 AM</a> with a group of Parisians and a Spanish girl, all of whom were leaving the next day. I kept hearing “fucking place” and we all piled into two separate taxis. A drive through the Taipei nervous system and we arrived at “The Fucking Place", a dingy bar that hosted an upward, wooden stairwell before you arrived inside. The place was packed with characters, beer was cheap, and I drunkenly watched the sunrise from a window as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180922203704/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv34BbEjrwo">“Hotel California”</a> played and a 28 year old Taiwanese ballet teacher grabbed my penis beneath the table. A grotesque women, she had the face of Methuselah, covered in powdery-white makeup and scarlet lipstick. Whenever I stood up she would swing her leg over my shoulder, thrust her pelvis at my cock, and emit gibberish. It was hectic and I remember not being adverse to roughly grabbing her ass, groin, or arms as she fed me white wine.</p>

<p>T.K. and I emerged into daylight from “The Fucking Place” around 5:00 AM. My perception was no longer smooth and everything was happening in “scenes”, just small increments separated by black. T.K. had lost both his shoes and we ate McDonalds on a curb beneath the Wenhu MRT line before going our separate ways. I was surprisingly only a two minute walk away from my apartment, which I found easily.</p>

<p>Upcoming events:
<br>- Possibly head to Lanyu, where S.T. knows a local I can stay with. </p>
<p>\\ NHR</p>


<p><strong>8/31/14</strong></p>
<p>I met T.K. at "Exit 2" of the "Xinyi Anhe" station on Saturday to go to dinner and then eventually make our way to Korner for a 5 hour DJ set. After dinner and some beer consumption at around 11:00 PM, we decided to walk instead of ride a taxi, and ended up traversing through NTU. Dispersed throughout the sprawling campus was over twenty groups of Taiwanese students seated in circle-formations, usually surrounding candles (their only light source) or incomprehensible signs with painted-on Chinese characters. Low mumbles of Mandarin could be heard from each circle as T.K. and I passed, and towards the end of our walk, as whatever ceremony or ritual the students were enacting climaxed, they all began clapping.</p>
<p>We arrived at the club early and, while waiting for S.T., smoked cigarettes near the "Ketamine Corner”, a shadowy nook behind Korner where T.K. claims to have “snorted a ton of K” (see picture below). Shortly after, S.T. arrived. The plan was to descend into Korner where each of us would receive & ingest a “dragon” Ecstasy tablet of which had already been paid for. The receiving of the chemical depended on a nebulous tango between at least four different players, and it wasn't until one hour into the set, at around 1:00 AM, that S.T. finally thrusted the small tablet into my mouth, and I, not even given a chance to see any Eastern serpent in its design, trustingly swallowed.
</p>
<p>Towards the beginning, the music untraceable house music - not distinctly good or bad, just a thick bass in order to promote body kinetics. Despite this, the attracted crowd was of a higher order than my last attendance. It wasn't until I found myself in close proximity to an energized female form that I felt the serotonin-spew of the MDMA. The bodies of mine and the female's began to seamlessly mesh into a state of pure synergy, catalyzed by a more tribal turn in the now thumping music. Almost equal to my height, she revealed herself to be a seventeen year old Brazilian named “Adriani", gifted with perfect, chestnut flesh and dawning a bejeweled “bindi” between her brows. Her clothing consisted of a cropped, blue & white striped tank-top with the phrase “Give Me Chocolate” inscribed above her breasts in a distinct “marker-felt” font. Beneath her fully exposed belly she wore denim short shorts. Both of our ectomorphic frames became one, and she, a dancing Dakini who must have been riding the same serpent as I, began kissing me passionately. Her lips were the most supple and palatable I have ever tasted, and our mouths & bodies moved in synchronous motion to the techno. My hair was completely drenched in bestial sweat and she would run her hands, illuminated by cobalt-blue finger lights, through my scalp and over my eyes, proceeding to tickle my face and chest. I would return the favor, scratching my fingers through her fibrous, black hair and down her electrified spinal cord while sucking her bindi in what felt like an attempt to absorb "protonic energy". In the midst of our dancing, her mystical entourage crowded the dance-floor and began releasing animal chants; howling, barking, and yelping beneath the rhythmic pulse of the club. They were oddities in Korner; plant-like people in the most unplant-like of environments. They were tricksters and magicians, spinners and jewelers. I imagined them deep in a forest, guzzling casks of viper-wine. One of the men, named “Vali”, with chest-length black hair, mounted the shoulders of another man. He entwined what looked like a bioluminescent snake through the air and across his body as the man below him trudged across the dance-floor. I witnessed Adriani’s sister, “Isabel", even taller and more beautiful than her sibling (but married to “Neo"), peacefully glide through the club with her forearms extended from her hips, palms up, a candle aflame on top of each palm. And who knows? Perhaps beneath those candles her skin brandished the soul of the pentagram.
</p>
<p>S.T. told me he spent the night wandering the dance-floor muttering gibberish to random people. I remember a few times he muttered to Adriani and I. He was convinced that one of the Vampires was standing in the back of the club, and kept insisting on it to T.K.. Sadly, my involvement with Adriani lasted only as long as the music did. To take her home was uncalled for and not even my decision, I knew I was a heathen to her group, who disappeared like phantoms. By the time it was all finished her and I were completely depleted anyways, and I later found at home that my penis was humorously shriveled & numb, while my skin was bone-grey. The sex had already happened in the dancing. I had felt the surge of my spermatic cord, and the cellular <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180922203749/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcTh2ub1Hs">interaction of gametes.</a>

<p>The Ecstasy high was ultra-<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180922203811/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQNi85lDN28">clean and precise.</a> My thoughts, although repetitious (I kept repeating the word “computer”) felt coherent, and when needing to speak, I felt none of the effects of inebriation. Rather, every emotional feeling (Brazilian involvement) and physical sensation (dancing) was completely enhanced. I was in a state of rapture, potentiated and accelerated not only by the flesh and nerves around me, but by all the surrounding technology. Everything felt pristinely “engineered”; pulsating visions of selenium cells blazed across my mind’s-eye while green laser-beams flashed across my face. Despite this, I am semi-convinced that the tablet also had caffeine, speed or meth in it. This is common if it is a tablet and not a capsule. Plus, I felt very “speedy” effects, especially towards the come-down. Although, this was not bad: it felt perfectly suitable and helpful for the environment I was in.
</p>
<p>My second experience at Korner has me more convinced that it belongs in the genealogy of mythic Taipei clubs like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180922203922/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2009/03/27/2003439486">Spin</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180922203954/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2013/06/14/2003564743">Underworld</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180922204017/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2004/01/09/2003086984">TeXound</a>. I remember thinking this while staring at the concrete floor, swamped in sweat. The club had been reconfigured my second time there, and another room with three tables in it had been uncaged. By the end of the night, heaps of limp, malnourished, drunken bodies had piled on top of the booths and each other. In the dim light it looked like a Baroque vision of Hell. Korner, not quite “underground", is still a burgeoning place full of archetypal characters, and perhaps it will persist...yet there is a brooding feeling that its essential destination is Golgotha, the Hill of Skulls.
</p>

<p>On Sunday, at around 12:00 AM, close to Korner, I smoked a joint with T.K., a few Taiwanese females, and the creators of a “zine” called "...", R.H. & M.H., two brothers from New Zealand but live in <a href="https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/2752129/original_63d8d45a0ec763bcbb10854951d39012.png">Taichung</a> (“Central Taiwan”). They hold exhibitions and events together, and are directly involved in the Asiatic noise scene, among other things. They have booked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merzbow">Merzbow</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180922204221/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP1UQ3hZXuA">at “The Wall”</a> (Korner’s "sister-venue", same location) as part of a noise tour they did through Taipei, Beijing, Hong Kong, and Macau. They are also closely associated with local Taiwanese artists like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180922204307/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRXcf3L7lv4">Betty Apple</a>. Hopefully I can find my way into something like <a href="http://youtu.be/YEiQMD85ZeQ?t=10s">this</a>? I also discovered they are directly involved in the up-to-now-cryptic mountain party I’ll be attending this upcoming Saturday (where I hope to see Adriani again), called "...", taking place <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/hrscywv4p/image/upload/c_limit,h_900,w_1200/neqaay3mibilwhc0gnf9.jpg">in a temple on “Tiger Mountain”</a>. They put me on to some artistic “hot-spots” in Taiwan such as "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121004235715/http://thecubespace.com:80/en/exhibitions/fantasy/liu-ho-jang.php">The Cube</a>”, "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180922211701/https://www.facebook.com/madL.art">Mad L</a>”, “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180922211737/https://www.vtartsalon.com/english/exhibition/current/">VT Art Salon</a>” and the “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180922211747/http://www.tcac.tw/">Taipei Contemporary Art Center</a>”. R// began speaking about the 2014 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160417163247/http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/taipei-biennial-2014-the-great-acceleration/">Taipei Biennial</a> (which I am excited for) declaring it a “bad model” and criminalizing it for not hosting enough “local artists” while his brother interjected with half-baked ideas on “capitalism winning” and “not wanting to cover the event”. They did not seem to be aware of any theory or work informing the phrase “Great Acceleration”. At one point, one of them pretentiously flaunted an idea from his thesis. The weed was weak, and only managed to retard my thoughts, causing me to loose any confidence and merely observe them as they talked. Despite this, I hope to have more interaction with the Brothers, and work my way into their noise-network.</p>
<p>Did not go to Korner that night (a show that I wish I had attended), but another event T.K. was on the “guest list” for. It was a Dead-Zone, but we got in for free and received free drinks and shots. We left after one hour with a Taiwanese boy-girl duo that Tim knew and we all wandered drunkenly through the empty streets like ancient commoners.</p>
<p>With the consumption of more alcohol, I have become even more fascinated by the great “spoiled grain” and its flow from the alchemy and chemistry tomes of early Baghdad all the way to the makeshift hobo techniques of straining.</p>

<p>T.K. is a fox while drunk. Crafty and cunning. I expect him to remove his shirt and for the face of the Jackal to be seared onto his back.</p>

<p>"Ketamine Corner"</p>
<p>\\ N</p>

<p><strong>8/27/15</strong></p>
<p><em>"Evan told tales of the dead who had been struck down by fate untimely, who knew they had been cheated of what was due to them and tried to return to life. If you had an eye for them they were to be seen quite often, said Evan. At first glance they seemed to be normal people, but when you looked more closely their faces would blur and flicker slightly at the edges. And they were usually a little shorter than they had been in life, for the experience of death, said Evan, diminishes us, just as a piece of linen shrinks when you first wash it. The dead almost always walked alone, but they sometimes go around in small troops; they had been seen wearing brightly colored uniforms or wrapped in gray cloaks, marching up the hill above the town to the soft beat of a drum, only a little taller than the walls around the fields through which they went. Evan told me a story of how his grandfather once had to step aside on the road from Frongastell to Pyrsau to let one of these ghostly processions pass by when it caught up with him. It had consisted entirely of beings of dwarfish stature who strode on at a fast pace, leaning forward slightly and talking to each other in reedy voices. Hanging from a hook on the wall above Evan’s low workbench, said Austerlitz, was the black veil that his grandfather had taken from the bier when the small figures muffled in their cloaks carried it past him, and it was certainly Evan, said Austerlitz, who once told me that nothing but a piece of silk like that separates us from the next world."</em></p>
