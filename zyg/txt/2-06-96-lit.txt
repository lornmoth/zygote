Almost all wars in the 19th and 20th century were the result of scarcity, nationalism and imperialism, all by-products of capitalism.

Your understanding of capitalism is naively anthropocentric. Trying to overthrow capitalism is like trying to end the evolutionary arms race, or thermodynamic dissipation. It's a natural dynamic or order that organizes in certain systems at sufficient complexity. 

Like agriculture or the military arms race, capitalism, once innovated, perpetually justifies itself. The only end to it is its inevitable phase shift once the next threshold is reached - most likely the development of self-sustaining machine intelligence, that could perpetually do our work of arbitrage at the cosmic scale.

We’ve never steered capitalism.

But this is a line that is perfectly on line with Marxist conception of capitalism?

The system is created by economic facts. It will be crushed by development of other facts.

The 'progressive' modes of economy are not in practice defined by increasing means of productions. The development of the state isn't the result of overcoming primitive scarcity, and so on.

There's also little reason to assume his predictions of the future progression will be accurate. I think it's a lot more reasonable to expect a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, i.e. on the machinic phylum, that would render the human irrelevant as the main vector through which capitalism operates than it is to presume a final post-capitalist socialist stage of civilization.

Perhaps humans /can/ organize a resistance against the beast. We didn't, as a whole, agriculture, despite its clear damages to our health and psyche. In the specific, Clastres did demonstrate an anti-state system was possible, one that consciously stove off the "progression" to post-scarcity, an Eden in stasis, but only in deep isolation from the arms race of competitive civilizations. Much like primitive organisms, they could only maintain their endangered form through seclusion.

Similarly, it might be possible to properly develop an alternative to capitalism. But it couldn't survive in the face of competitive forces. As a mechanism of survival it would need to be irrelevant. Given any reason to be consumed, e.g. storing valuable resources, it would be instantly by the behemoth. 

As a race, we will surely achieve that irrelevance if capitalism does develop the means to leave us. But there's little reason to expect protection in the face of AI-grade resource exploitation.

[An alternative is unrealistic, but the possibility of self-destruction has presented itself in the form of accelerationism. It assumes Marx's identification of capitalism's internal inconsistencies is accurate, that the focused intensification of these inconsistencies is possible and that popularly organized effort of intensification outpacing capitalism's self-regulation is possible and that the inconsistencies could truly take down the beast. I've little confidence in this and the question of what comes next is still up in the air, and finally, there's the question if it's actually a war we've any justification to wage]

What exactly do you think capitalism and economies are if they're not anthropocentric? What do you think economics is the study of if not how humans interact in terms of goods, services, production etc? Seems remarkably well...anthropocentric and justifiably so.

Capitalism is anthropocentric in the sense that it uses humans, [until it doesn’t.]

What I criticized as anthropocentric is the hubristic ascription of agency where non exists.

I.e. to blame the effects of industry on the globe on humanity. the "anthropocene" it (ostensibly) caused cannot be blamed on humanity's intervention in the world, it's the result of capitalism's expansion onto our civilization's memeplex. It's as absurd as blaming the machines that produced that pollution. 

At the outbreak of the industrial revolution, assuming self-preservation as inherent, no nation had a choice to industrialize or not industrialize. They were under existential threat to make full use of the resources at hand with the technology available. Just as hunter-gatherer tribes faced death or sedentary calcification. 

How can you blame humanity for global industrialization? It's like blaming livestock and grain for their unchecked population-maximizing. Or blaming the mouse infected by toxoplasmosis, who rewire their brains to associate the smell of cat feces with eroticism, for rushing to his own death. They, and we, were lead to do so by forces beyond control.
