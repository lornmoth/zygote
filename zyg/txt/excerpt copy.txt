For the reference of my friends,

Do you live today? No, you don't - you wander like a ghost. I have seldom met an intellectual who would not have admitted this in a bright hour. Only few have acted on this knowledge. They want on wandering hauntingly, thrown hither and thither, defenseless victims of an insoluble contradiction.

Everything changed once they had lives of their own and knew they had lives of their own. It even became impossible for them to believe things had ever been any other way. They were masters of their movements now, as it seemed, and never had there been anything like them. The epoch had passed when the whole of their being was open to the world and nothing divided them from the rest of creation. 

Something had happened. They did not know what it was, but they did know it as that which /should not be/. And something needed to be done if they were to flourish as they once had, if the very ground beneath their feet were not to fall out from under them... 

The whole of their being was closed to the world, and they had been divided from the rest of creation. Nothing could be done about that, having as they did lives of their own. But something would have to be done if they were to live with that which /should not be/.
